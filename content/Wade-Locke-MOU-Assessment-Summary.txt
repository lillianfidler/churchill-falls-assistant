TOPIC: Wade Locke's critical assessment of the December 2024 Churchill Falls MOU — cautiously optimistic but identifying significant information gaps and concerns

---

WADE LOCKE'S MAIN ASSESSMENT

Cautiously optimistic with significant concerns. The MOU represents substantial revenue increases BUT lacks sufficient detail to demonstrate it is better than the 1969 contract. Locke warns: "We still need to be wary of being snookered by others with more sophistication but different long-term goals and interests."

The central question Locke poses: Is this a good deal, or "the start of another bad deal in which Newfoundland and Labrador has been snookered again, but this time in a more sophisticated way than in 1969?"

---

POSITIVES IDENTIFIED BY LOCKE

Revenues are substantial and potentially transformative. There is some protection from cost overruns and delays. NL receives a 183% increase in power available for Labrador. There is a substantial immediate revenue increase.

CONCERNS IDENTIFIED BY LOCKE

There is insufficient information to thoroughly evaluate projects. The province is NOT protected from all risks. The MOU requires borrowing close to current net debt level ($17-18 billion). Many legitimate questions remain unanswered. There is a lack of detail on key financial mechanisms.

1969 CONTRACT CONTEXT

Original terms: 1969-2016 at 0.25¢/kWh; 2016-2041 at 0.2¢/kWh (lower than the original). Historic inequity as of 2019: Quebec profits approximately $28 billion, NL profits approximately $2 billion. Feehan and Baker (2010) noted it was "unlikely CF(L)Co will cover operating costs."

---

GOVERNMENT CLAIMS VS. LOCKE'S CORRECTIONS

CLAIM: "$1 billion/year to treasury." LOCKE'S CORRECTION: CF(L)Co receives $1.17 billion average (not treasury). NL treasury gets 65.8% share, which equals $768 million annually. Not $1 billion to treasury as claimed.

CLAIM: "Four times as much energy for Labrador." LOCKE'S CORRECTION: 3,900 MW is the COMBINED increase from all projects. NL access increases from 525 MW to 1,990 MW. Actual increase: 378% (not 400%).

CLAIM: "Fully protected from cost overruns." LOCKE'S CORRECTION: NL IS exposed to 100% of transmission line cost overruns, 65.8% of Churchill Falls upgrade overruns. Only Gull Island and CF expansion have HQ accepting overruns.

---

PRICING MECHANISM

MOU price increase: from 0.2¢/kWh to 5.9¢/kWh (30 times higher). Prices will escalate over time and are tied to market prices. CRITICAL GAP: Prices are described as "reflective of" Quebec wholesale market, replacement costs, and northeast export markets, but there is NO indication of weights attached to each factor. Future revenue therefore cannot be properly assessed.

---

THE $33.8 BILLION FIGURE

This is the present value of nominal revenue discounted at 5.822%. It represents the amount needed to invest today to generate equivalent cash flow. It is NOT "today's dollars" as commonly understood. Total payments: $195 billion in nominal dollars to CF(L)Co over the contract term; $33.8 billion in present value.

PROJECT BREAKDOWN

Gull Island (2,250 MW): 60% NLH, 40% HQ ownership. Capital cost $24.9 billion (including financing). Target 2035. Return on equity 8-9% (Canada 10-year plus 500 basis points). HQ accepts cost overruns. 50-year PPA, no automatic renewal. NL access: 225 MW.

Churchill Falls Expansion (1,100 MW): 65.8% NLH, 34.2% HQ (CF(L)Co). Capital cost $4.6 billion (including financing). Target 2035. Return 8-9%. HQ accepts cost overruns. 50-year PPA. NL access: 135 MW.

Churchill Falls Upgrade (550 MW): 65.8% NLH, 34.2% HQ. Capital cost $1.9 billion (including financing). Rollout 2028-2038. Cost-plus pricing. NL exposed to 65.8% of overruns. NL access: 135 MW.

---

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS

NL debt requirements: Total project costs $35.0 billion. NL equity obligations $5.7 billion. HQ payment for equity $4.8 billion. NL still needs to borrow $17-18 billion. Context: approximately EQUAL to current provincial net debt.

HQ payment: $4.8 billion nominal ($3.5 billion present value), for 40% of Gull Island and development rights. Locke's question: Is 40% of Gull Island's NPV greater than $3.5 billion?

---

REVENUE COMPARISON

Current (2023): CF(L)Co total $103 million. From HQ plus GWAC: $65 million. NL treasury (65.8%): approximately $43 million.

MOU average (to 2041): CF(L)Co total $1.17 billion (11 times increase). From new PPA $1.17 billion (18 times increase). NL treasury $768 million (18 times increase).

---

EMPLOYMENT

Construction jobs: Average 3,000 direct, 5,000 total. Peak: 5,000 direct, 9,500 total. Period: 5-11 years depending on project. Hiring protocol (in order): Innu Nation (qualified), Labrador residents, provincial residents, rest of Canada.

---

CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED BY LOCKE

Cannot calculate NPV because MOU omits: time profile of capital costs, time profile of operations and maintenance costs, production profile for electricity, time profile of expected prices, detailed power flow breakdown, pricing mechanism weights, and conditions for HQ payments.

Locke's conclusion: "Not sufficient information in the MOU to thoroughly evaluate all, or any, of the proposed new developments."

LOCKE'S PERSPECTIVE ON ANALYSIS

This is independent critique from a respected Memorial University economist. Locke is NOT saying the deal is bad — he is saying there is insufficient information to fully assess it. Analysis was done with publicly available information only. More detailed assessment requires confidential negotiating data. Locke remains "cautiously optimistic" but many questions remain.

CLOSING WARNING: "We should learn from our history, not be constrained by it. We ought not to be afraid to make a good deal that is in our interest, but we need to be wary given that we do not know the future with precision."
