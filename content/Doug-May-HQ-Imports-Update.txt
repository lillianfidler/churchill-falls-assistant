Québec’s Changing Import Picture:
(Follows Video #3-A in the CRPP Series)
Doug May

The Role Of Churchill Falls Import in
Quebec’s Electricity Picture (Video 3-A)
• Churchill Falls electricity is a necessary “import” to Hydro-Québec. It
guarantees Quebec a long-term, secure, and extremely cheap source,
of electricity to meet its own domestic needs and to profitably export
electricity to NB and particularly to the USA.
• As such, CF electricity enables HQ to provide Quebec households and
businesses with the cheapest power in Canada and the G7, which
include the USA.
• Some would say that NL “subsidizes” Quebec’s low electricity prices.
• The key to CF electricity’s low price is the almost free cost of the vast
water resources of the Churchill River.
• As the former Government of Newfoundland and Labrador wrote in it
“Our Chapter” , it hopes the MOU will unlock the “value” of CF.

HQ’s Import Picture 2022 & Earlier
• In 2022, 14.0 % of the electricity available to Quebec came from
imports.
• 13.7% of the available power came from other provinces, some from
Ontario but the vast majority from Churchill Falls.
• 0.3% came from the USA
• Before 2022, HQ rarely imported power from the USA.

The Amazing Restructuring of
HQ’s Import Picture in 2024 & 2025
• In the first ten months of 2025, total imports were up 3.5% from the same
period last year.
• Imports from other provinces we down 13.3% during this period. It is not
clear to me why this is occurring since, I believe, most of this imported
power likely comes from Churchill Falls. This power is absolutely and
relatively cheaper than power from elsewhere, and so why the decline
when total imports increased.
• In 2024, 17.4% of the electricity available to Quebec came from imports.
• 15.7% of the available power came from other provinces.
• An approximate estimation is that about 31.5 TWh of electricity imported
into Quebec in 2024 came from Churchill Falls. This represented about
80.6% of the total imported power.
• 1.7% came from the USA

• In the first ten months of 2025, imports from the USA were up
128.9%!
• During this period, imports from the USA were greater than
exports by 38.8%. Traditionally, exports to the USA are greater are
greater than imports. This is an amazing change in electricity
trading patterns with the USA.

Imports From Vermont and New York State
• Once again, the chart below illustrates the remarkable changes in
import patterns. Imports from New York start to play a continuing
and more significant role in 2023. Imports from Vermont come
into the picture in late 2024 and increasingly in the second half of
2025.
• The nature of the imports is changing rapidly after many years of
the picture being constant. It is hard to predict what 2026 and
beyond will look like.
• For Hydro-Quebec security of supply may not be there since it is
entering competitive and dynamic U.S. markets.

US Import Prices Paid by
Hydro-Québec in Canadian Dollars
• The chart below should be used with caution. Prices (Canadian
dollars) in 2022 reflect the inflationary forces in play after the
pandemic of 2020-21.
• Electricity production in these U.S. states began to use more
natural gas in electricity production and these gas prices began to
fall in 2023.
• The cost of gas plays a significant role in explaining the price of
electricity. Water is relatively very cheap and explains why
hydroelectricity is relatively so cheap.
• Electricity prices will rise in the winter months as household
demand increases and gas production and transmission is
affected by cold weather.

My Summary
• There is a growing dependency in Quebec on imported power,
particularly relatively expensive electricity (about 25 times more
expensive than CF electricity) from the USA.
• The changing picture is a remarkable change from the historic picture.
• The future picture is unfolding but it puts Québec in a very difficult
position if it continues.
• Over the past decade Quebec has entered into agreements with its
traditional trading partners and made infrastructure investments
assuming its export of green low-cost electricity would continue.
Instead, the electricity is flowing into Quebec and not from it!
• Churchill Falls, with its super cheap power, has reached its generating
capacity and cannot export more power to Quebec.
• Does Hydro-Québec have a long-term problem?
