Purpose: Concise version for fast voice responses - Doug May's perspective

DOUG'S MAIN ARGUMENT (VIDEO 1):

Quebec faces a serious electricity crisis: supply is declining while demand is rising. Churchill Falls currently provides about 17% of Quebec's electricity and will be critical to solving Quebec's shortage through the MOU's proposed expansions.

KEY POINTS FROM DOUG'S ANALYSIS:

QUEBEC'S ELECTRICITY PROBLEM:
• Starting 2023: Drought in northern Quebec (James Bay area) causing major problems
• La Grande Rivière projects (including Robert-Bourassa dam) producing less power
• June 2025 data shows power levels lower than ever recorded since 2015
• Quebec's hydroelectric generation declining - previously over 90% of total utility generation

DEMAND PRESSURES INCREASING:
• AI data centers requiring massive electricity
• Electric vehicle adoption growing
• Population growth
• Industrial expansion
• Peak winter demand (January): over 25 million megawatt-hours
• Critical: Producers MUST meet peak winter demands for heating

THE CRISIS EQUATION:
• Supply: Going DOWN (due to drought)
• Demand: Going UP (AI, EVs, population, industry)
• Result: Serious shortage with minimal gap between supply and demand
• Hydro-Québec projects this will worsen

IMPORT DEPENDENCY SHIFT:
• Pre-2023: Quebec imported mostly from other provinces (mainly Churchill Falls)
• Post-2023: Pattern break - now importing from United States (New York)
• Quebec still exports to US BUT now also imports from US - unprecedented
• March 2025: Heavy imports from New York showing dependency

CHURCHILL FALLS' CRITICAL ROLE:
• Provides approximately 17% of Quebec's available electricity
• Assumes ~90% of Churchill Falls power goes to Quebec
• Production remains STABLE while Quebec's own generation DECLINES
• CF(L)Co ownership: 34.2% Hydro-Québec, 65.8% NL Hydro

COST ADVANTAGE AT RISK:
• Quebec's competitive advantage: Low electricity prices from cheap hydro power
• Wind power is MORE EXPENSIVE than hydro
• Quebec increasingly relying on expensive wind to fill gap
• Churchill Falls power is "very, very cheap"
• Large hydro stations key to maintaining low prices

MOU'S THREE PROJECTS (3,900 MW TOTAL):

1. Gull Island Project: 2,250 MW (NEW - largest addition)
2. Churchill Falls Upgrade: 550 MW (11 new turbines replacing existing)
3. Churchill Falls Extension: 1,100 MW (2 new turbines, expansion)

WHY MOU MATTERS TO QUEBEC:
• Addresses urgent need for additional cheap hydroelectric power
• Maintains cost advantage (hydro cheaper than wind)
• 3,900 MW represents "quite a contribution" to shortage solution
• Provides stable, reliable supply vs. declining Quebec generation

COMPARATIVE CONTEXT:
• Robert-Bourassa dam: Higher rated capacity than Churchill Falls but ~78% capacity utilization
• Churchill Falls: Stable production pattern
• NL generation: Fairly constant, no significant decline
• Quebec generation: Declining trend even with wind power increases

DOUG'S METHODOLOGY:
• Statistics Canada monthly data (January 2015 - June 2025)
• Hydro-Québec reports and projections
• Comparative cost analysis (hydro vs. wind)

OWNERSHIP COMPLEXITY:
• Hydro-Québec imports power from CF(L)Co
• But HQ owns 34.2% of CF(L)Co
• Creates unique dynamics - importing from company you partially own
