SERIES: Video 3B of 6 examining Quebec's electricity landscape
FOCUS: Export volumes and prices from Hydro-Quebec, primarily to the United States
NOTE: Companion to Video 3A on imports. This video examines the export side of Hydro-Quebec's electricity trade.

PRODUCTION VERSUS AVAILABILITY VERSUS EXPORTS

The supply chart from previous videos shows domestic production in Quebec, total electricity available in Quebec, and the differences between them. The difference between production and availability represents imports covered in Video 3A. The difference between availability and domestic demand represents net exports. Hydro-Quebec can be both exporting and importing simultaneously with the same state or province.

TOTAL EXPORT VOLUMES: DECLINING TREND

Quebec exports to both the United States and other provinces, primarily New Brunswick. Total exports are going down over time due to drought. U.S. exports have historically been above provincial exports, but a dramatic recent shift has occurred. U.S. exports are declining more rapidly than provincial exports, and by June 2025 U.S. exports had fallen below exports to other provinces. New Brunswick remains the primary provincial destination due to long-term relationships with Hydro-Quebec.

Despite Quebec's reputation as a major power-exporting province, the current reality is that total exports amount to less than 5% of total power available, with exports to the United States at approximately 1.5%. Dr. May describes this as quite surprising. Quebec has made heavy recent investments in new transmission lines into New England ISO through Maine and into New York, but these are presumably not really being used.

U.S. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION ANALYSIS

EIA data on Eastern connections trade patterns between Hydro-Quebec and the New England ISO and New York ISO reveals a major reversal. Historically before 2023, New York received greater imports from Quebec than New England. By 2023 this shifted dramatically: most imports into the U.S. now come through the New York connection, while New England is now exporting power into Quebec. The transmission lines designed to take power from Quebec into New England are instead taking power from New England into Quebec, representing a complete reversal of intended power flow direction.

EXPORT AND IMPORT PRICING FROM EIA DATA

East of Canada for these purposes means Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes, and Labrador. Prices move around significantly. U.S. exports to Canada show an increasing trend with peaks around October reaching approximately $140 per megawatt-hour or 14 cents per kWh. Canadian exports to the U.S. show fair volatility with significant spikes over $150 per megawatt-hour or 15 cents per kWh.

Notably, prices for interprovincial electricity trade are not publicly available. Hydro-Quebec, New Brunswick Energy, and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro know these prices but are not sharing them. Dr. May expresses frustration: "It's strange. You're trying to examine what's going on, but you can't get a hold of the information that you'd really like to."

EXPORT VOLUMES BY DESTINATION

Volume data from the Canada Energy Regulator is fairly accurate though price and value data is sometimes inconsistent. Quebec exports to New York were on an increasing trend through 2022 but experienced a big dive in 2023 and continued low in 2024-2025. Quebec exports to the New England ISO have been on a declining trend and were virtually non-existent by 2023.

Meanwhile, Newfoundland and Labrador exports tell an interesting story. NL exports to New York were steady initially, dropped in the middle period, but are now picking back up. NL exports to New England, previously minimal, have seen a significant increase recently. Dr. May observes that where Quebec was not shipping into New England, Newfoundland and Labrador stepped in to fill that role.

EXPORT PRICES TO U.S. MARKETS

Pricing data in Canadian dollars per megawatt-hour shows seasonal patterns clearly visible across exporters, with highs in January, slight increases in July and August, and consistent repetition of this pattern. Prices follow somewhat similar patterns across different exporters.

In July 2025, Hydro-Quebec exports to Maine were priced at $192.53 per megawatt-hour or 19.25 cents per kWh. NL Hydro exports to New England in the same period were at a similar range, approximately 19.24 cents per kWh.

The profit margin analysis is striking. Production cost is approximately 0.3 cents per kWh, Quebec's price to CF(L)Co is approximately 0.48 cents per kWh or about half a cent, and export price to New England is approximately 19 cents per kWh. Dr. May notes that spread from 0.3 or half a cent to 19 cents represents a profit margin of approximately 40-63 times markup from cost to export price.

Some data points appear questionable. Quebec exports to New York in June 2025 showed a reported price of $265.12 per megawatt-hour or 26.5 cents per kWh. Dr. May expresses skepticism about this figure but notes for context that his family in Boston pays approximately 43 cents per kWh in U.S. dollars, suggesting high prices are not impossible in these markets.

PROFIT MAXIMIZATION IN EXPORT MARKETS

Export markets, particularly American ones, are very free markets where prices vary day to day, month to month, and within months at different times. Hydro-Quebec operates as a profit maximizer in export markets, using reservoir management strategically to generate power when prices are highest. Their annual reports discuss this strategy openly and show substantial profits from it.

NL Hydro also becomes a profit maximizer when not required to sell to Quebec and when Quebec does not want the power, allowing sales into American markets.

---

THE VOLUME-PRICE-PROFIT RELATIONSHIP

Despite declining export volumes, rising prices more than compensate, so Hydro-Quebec's reported profits from exports are increasing. Prices are rising primarily because generation costs in New England and New York are increasing due to natural gas turbines with rising gas prices, and because demand is increasing from growing electricity consumption, technology expansion including AI and electric vehicles, and population growth.

---

SEASONAL PRICING STRATEGY

Export prices are highest in January and February during winter peak demand, with secondary peaks in July and August for summer cooling demand. Prices are lowest in spring months of April and May and fall months of October and November.

The storage battery strategy involves using reservoirs as huge storage batteries, importing cheap power when available such as Churchill Falls at 0.3 cents per kWh, saving Quebec reservoir water, generating from Quebec reservoirs when export prices are highest, and exporting to the U.S. at 15-26 cents per kWh. The profit potential is 50-80 times cost.

KEY STATISTICS

Export volumes: total Quebec exports less than 5% of total power available, Quebec to U.S. approximately 1.5% of total power, trend declining especially to U.S. Export prices per kWh: July 2025 to New England at 19.24 cents, reported peaks to New York up to 26.5 cents, typical range 14-26 cents. Profit margins: production cost 0.3 cents per kWh, Churchill Falls import 0.48 cents per kWh, export price 14-26 cents per kWh, margin 40-80 times cost. Seasonal pattern: peak export prices in January and February and July and August, low prices in spring and fall, pattern consistent across years. Volume trends by destination: Quebec to New York declining from 2022 with major drop in 2023, Quebec to New England virtually non-existent by 2023, NL to New England increasing significantly, NL to New York steady with recent increase. Key reversal: New England transmission now importing into Quebec in the opposite direction from intended.
