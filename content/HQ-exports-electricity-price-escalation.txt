AUTHOR: Dr. Doug May
DOCUMENT TYPE: Presentation/Analysis
DATE: 2025 (references data through August 2025)
DATA SOURCES: Statistics Canada Table 25-10-0016-01, Canada Energy Regulator, HQ Semi-Annual Report 2025

CENTRAL QUESTION: "Do current export prices faced by HQ tell us anything about potential future price escalations?"

ANSWER: **YES** - Current US export market prices provide insight into future escalation patterns

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Findings

**Export volumes dramatically declining:**
- Total exports down 80.8% (August 2025 vs August 2022)
- USA exports down 93.7% (August 2025 vs August 2022)
- Interprovincial exports down 57.9% (August 2025 vs August 2022)

**Export prices escalating rapidly:**
- Maine Q1 2025: $177.95 CAD/MWh (17.80¢/kWh)
- Maine Q1 2024: 8.32¢/kWh
- **Increase: 114% year-over-year**

**Strategic shift:**
- Exports to New Brunswick now generally exceed USA exports
- USA exports spike only during high-price winter months
- HQ is "profit maximizer" - exports when prices are highest

**MOU pricing concern:**
- MOU specifies 2% annual escalation
- Market reality: 114% increase in one year
- MOU pricing "detached from market realities"

---

## DRAMATIC CHANGES IN HQ EXPORT PICTURE

### What We've Learned About HQ's Exports

**1. Export volumes generally falling**
- As percentage of total electricity available
- Consistent decline over 3-year period

**2. Exports to other provinces (NB) in 2025:**
- Generally greater than USA exports
- More stable, long-term commitment pattern

**3. Exports to USA:**
- Exceed interprovincial only during winter months
- When northeastern USA electricity prices particularly high

**4. Net exports to USA:**
- Generally NEGATIVE
- USA imports more than it exports (HQ importing from USA)

**5. Export destinations (per Canada Energy Regulator):**
- HQ exports to Maine and New York
- **Does NOT export to New England** (per CER data)
- **BUT**: HQ's mid-year report states New England is "primary export market"
- Data inconsistency issue

## EXPORT VOLUME DECLINE: THE NUMBERS

### Year-Over-Year Changes (August 2025 vs August 2024)

| Category | Change |
|----------|--------|
| Total Exports | **-45.4%** |
| Exports to Other Provinces | **-29.1%** |
| Exports to USA | **-70.7%** |

### Three-Year Decline (August 2025 vs August 2022)

| Category | Change |
|----------|--------|
| Total Exports | **-80.8%** |
| Exports to Other Provinces | **-57.9%** |
| Exports to USA | **-93.7%** |

**Interpretation:**
- Massive contraction in export capacity
- USA exports hit hardest
- Even interprovincial exports down nearly 60%

---

## EXPORT PATTERNS AND SEASONALITY

### Seasonal Pattern Observed

**Exports occur primarily during:**
1. **Hotter summer months** (July-August)
2. **Colder winter months** (January-February)

**Drivers:**
- **Climate:** Affects both demand and supply
- **Climate change:** Increasingly important factor
- **Peak pricing:** Corresponds to highest demand periods

### Strategic Shift in Export Mix

**Historical pattern (pre-2023):**
- USA exports dominated
- Interprovincial exports secondary

**Current pattern (2023-2025):**
- **Longer-term commitments to NB beginning to dominate**
- USA exports now secondary
- USA exports concentrated in high-price periods only

**Implication:** HQ prioritizing stable long-term contracts over opportunistic spot market sales

---

## HQ'S NEW ENGLAND COMMITMENTS: THE CONTRACT PROBLEM

### NECEC Agreement Details

**Contract terms:**
- **20-year supply** of clean, reliable, baseload energy
- **9.45 TWh per annum** (terawatt-hours)
- Electricity produced by **"extensive fleet of Hydro-Québec hydroelectric power plants"**
- Reduces dependence on fossil fuels in New England

**Benefits claimed:**
- Supply clean energy to **1.2 million New England households**
- **Stable prices for next 20 years** (avoiding peak demand price spikes)
- Customer savings: **$3,900 million over 20 years**
  - Massachusetts: $150M annually
  - Maine: $40M annually

### THE CRITICAL QUESTION

**⚠️ "Does Churchill Falls qualify as a Hydro-Quebec hydroelectric power plant? Maybe"**

**Significance:**
- NECEC contract commits to power from "HQ hydroelectric power plants"
- Churchill Falls provides 17% of Quebec's electricity
- Is HQ using Churchill Falls power to fulfill NECEC commitments?
- If yes: NL subsidizing New England electricity at 0.2¢/kWh while NE pays stable long-term rates

---

## USA EXPORT PRICES: THE ESCALATION STORY

### Maine Export Price Data (Canada Energy Regulator)

**Q1 2025 average:** $177.95 CAD/MWh (17.80¢ CAD/kWh)
**Q1 2024 average:** 8.32¢/kWh

**Year-over-year increase:** **114%**

**Monthly price volatility observed:**
- Prices exceed $200/MWh in some months
- High winter prices (January-February peaks)
- Lower prices in shoulder seasons

### HQ's Export Strategy (from HQ Semi-Annual Report 2025)

**Official statement:**
> "The company increased electricity exports to take advantage of high prices in a context marked by strong demand."

**Market commentary:**
> "On markets outside Québec, weather conditions experienced during the first few months of the year led to an overall increase in energy prices. This was especially true in New England, Hydro-Québec's primary export market."

**Key insight:** HQ is **profit maximizer** - exports more when prices are highest

### New England Market Prices (First Half 2025)

**From HQ Semi-Annual Report chart:**

**January-February 2025:** ~18-19¢/kWh
**2020-2024 average (Jan-Feb):** ~8¢/kWh
**Increase:** Over 100%

**March 2025 price collapse:** From ~19¢ to ~5¢/kWh
**April-June 2025:** Stabilized around 4-5¢/kWh
**2020-2024 average (Apr-Jun):** ~4-5¢/kWh

**Pattern:** Extreme winter price spikes, then return to baseline

---

## HQ'S MID-YEAR 2025 PERFORMANCE ON EXPORTS

### Official HQ Statement: "Strong Performance on Export Markets"

**Colder winter: Increase in market prices**

**Key metrics:**
- Sales of approximately **6 TWh** at **16¢/kWh** in 2025
- Compare to: **9¢/kWh** in 2024
- **Increase: 78% year-over-year**

**Attribution:**
> "Increase in income as a result of an efficient marketing strategy, supported by the reliability and performance of its generation and transmission equipment"

**Translation:** HQ exported during highest-price periods, maximized profit

---

## EXPORT DESTINATIONS: DATA INCONSISTENCY ISSUES

### Canada Energy Regulator Data

**HQ exports to:**
1. **Maine** - Consistent monthly exports, price data available
2. **New York** - Exports via interconnections
3. **New England (ISO-NE)** - **NO EXPORTS REPORTED** by CER

### HQ's Own Statements

**From Semi-Annual Report 2025:**
> "New England, Hydro-Québec's **primary export market**"

### The Discrepancy

**Two possibilities:**
1. **Data classification issue:** CER classifying NE exports under Maine/NY
2. **Transmission path:** Power to New England routed through Maine, counted as Maine exports
3. **Timing:** NECEC agreement implementation may not yet be fully reflected in CER data

**For Churchill Falls analysis:**
- HQ clearly targeting New England market
- NECEC and CHPE contracts commit significant volumes
- Whether counted as Maine or NE exports, market reality is same

---

## NEW BRUNSWICK EXPORTS

### Export Volume Pattern

**General observation:**
- More stable than USA exports
- Lower volumes after 2022
- Continues seasonal pattern but less pronounced

### HQ-NB Power Relationship

**Long-term commitments:**
- HQ involved in power projects in NB
- Long-term contracts including one to **2040**
- Not 51-year term like Churchill Falls

**Export pricing:**
- **No fixed rate**
- Rate **reflects market conditions**
- **Not made public** (to Dr. May's knowledge)

**Comparison to MOU:**
- NB contract to 2040 (16 years remaining as of 2024)
- Pricing tied to market conditions (not fixed escalation)
- Churchill Falls MOU to 2075 (51 years) with 2% annual escalation

---

## ANSWERING THE CENTRAL QUESTION

### Do Current Export Prices Tell Us About Future Price Escalations?

**Dr. May's Answer: YES**

**Reasoning:**

**1. Competitive market pricing:**
- USA prices in more competitive environment
- Natural gas turbines = closest alternative to hydro/wind
- Gas prices drive electricity pricing

**2. Free market dynamics:**
- Reflects variations in demand and supply:
  - During the day (peak vs off-peak)
  - During the year (seasonal)
  - Over time (long-term trends)

**3. Market evolution:**
- "The electricity market in the USA is very dynamic and will change radically over the next few years"
- Renewable energy transition accelerating
- Demand increasing (electrification, AI/data centers)

**4. Government of NL agrees:**
- GNL references USA market prices as benchmarks in MOU documentation
- Implicitly accepts market pricing as valid reference

---

## GNL'S OWN PRICE REFERENCES (FROM MOU MATERIALS)

### Reference Prices Provided by Government of Newfoundland and Labrador

| Reference | Price (¢/kWh) | Note |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| New York ISO (YTD) | 4.3¢ | Competitive market rate |
| ISO New England (YTD) | 5.3¢ | Competitive market rate |
| **New CF PPA** | **5.9¢** | **MOU proposed price** |
| HQ Long-Term Contracts (NECEC & CHPE) | 6.5¢ | 20-year agreements |

**Acronyms:**
- **NECEC:** New England Clean Energy Connect
- **CHPE:** Champlain Hudson Power Express

### Dr. May's Analysis

**GNL is using USA market prices as benchmark for MOU pricing**

**But:**
- Reference prices are year-to-date averages
- **Actual peak prices much higher** (17.80¢ in Q1 2025)
- MOU price (5.9¢) only 11% above ISO-NE average
- MOU price 9% below HQ's long-term contract rate (6.5¢)

**Critical concern:**
- Market prices increased 114% in one year
- MOU specifies 2% annual escalation
- "Those prices are detached from market realities, especially in the rapidly evolving electricity market"

---

## THE 2% ESCALATION PROBLEM

### Market Reality vs MOU Terms

**Actual market price increase (Maine, Q1 2024 to Q1 2025):**
- 8.32¢/kWh → 17.80¢/kWh
- **Increase: 114%** (more than doubled)

**MOU proposed escalation:**
- **2% annual increase** (fixed rate)

**The disconnect:**
- **Part** of 114% increase attributable to colder winter 2025
- **But:** Actual increase "significantly greater than 2%"
- Fixed 2% rate ignores market dynamics

### Why This Matters for Newfoundland and Labrador

**Scenario over 50 years:**

**If prices follow 2% escalation (MOU):**
- Year 1: 5.9¢/kWh
- Year 10: 7.19¢/kWh
- Year 25: 9.68¢/kWh
- Year 50: 15.79¢/kWh

**If prices follow market trends (historical 114% spike shows volatility):**
- Could reach 15.79¢ within 10-15 years, not 50
- Or could fluctuate dramatically year-to-year
- NL locked into 2% while HQ sells into volatile markets

**The value gap:**
- HQ buying from NL at 5.9¢ + 2% escalation
- HQ selling to USA at 17.80¢ (Q1 2025)
- **Profit margin: 201%**

---

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR CHURCHILL FALLS CONTEXT

### 1. Churchill Falls Enables HQ Export Profits

**The arbitrage:**
- Import from Churchill Falls: 0.2¢/kWh (current) or 5.9¢/kWh (MOU)
- Export to Maine: 17.80¢/kWh (Q1 2025)
- **Current profit margin:** 8,800%
- **MOU profit margin:** 201%

**"It's plausible that NL exports from CF to HQ enables HQ to export electricity at very profitable prices to the US markets"**

### 2. HQ is Profit Maximizer

**Evidence:**
- Increases exports when prices high
- "Efficient marketing strategy" (per HQ)
- Targets peak price periods
- Reduces exports when prices low

**Implication for NL:**
- HQ will maximize profit from Churchill Falls power
- Will sell into highest-priced markets
- NL receives fixed price regardless of market

### 3. Data Reliability Issues

**CER data appears inconsistent:**
- Value and price data for New York questionable
- No HQ exports to NE reported by CER
- But HQ states NE is "primary export market"

**Most reliable source:** HQ's own reports

### 4. Export Volumes Declining But Profits Rising

**Paradox:**
- Exports down 80.8% over 3 years
- But export revenue and profit increasing
- **Reason:** Price increases outpace volume decreases

**For MOU assessment:**
- Volume may not indicate profit
- Price escalation is critical factor
- 2% fixed escalation may significantly undervalue power

### 5. Long-Term Contracts at Premium Prices

**HQ's NECEC and CHPE contracts:**
- 6.5¢/kWh (20-year terms)
- 10% premium over MOU price (5.9¢)
- Includes price stability for buyers

**Question:** Why is NL accepting 5.9¢ for 50 years when HQ gets 6.5¢ for 20 years from New England?

### 6. Climate Change Impact

**Observed effects:**
- Affecting supply (drought reducing hydro production)
- Affecting demand (temperature extremes)
- Creating price volatility

**Long-term trend:**
- Electricity increasingly valuable
- Renewable sources (like Churchill Falls hydro) at premium
- Fixed escalation ignores climate-driven price increases

---

## DR. MAY'S IMPLICIT CONCERNS

### What the Presentation Suggests (Reading Between the Lines)

**1. MOU pricing fundamentally flawed:**
- 2% escalation ignores market reality
- Market prices doubled in one year
- 50-year fixed escalation = giving away value

**2. Churchill Falls subsidizing New England:**
- HQ's NECEC contract promises HQ hydroelectric power
- Churchill Falls is 17% of HQ's electricity
- New England getting cheap, clean power enabled by NL's cheap power to HQ

**3. HQ's "efficient marketing strategy":**
- Means maximizing profit
- Buying cheap from NL, selling high to USA
- NL not participating in upside

**4. Data transparency issues:**
- Interprovincial prices "not sharing with us" (from earlier May videos)
- CER price data "sometimes inconsistent"
- Hard to verify actual value of Churchill Falls power

**5. Government of NL using contradictory logic:**
- References USA market prices as benchmarks
- Then accepts 2% fixed escalation
- Ignores own reference prices showing volatility

---

## COMPARISON: MARKET PRICES VS MOU PRICING

### Current Market Reference Points (from GNL and Dr. May)

**USA competitive markets:**
- New York ISO YTD: 4.3¢/kWh
- ISO New England YTD: 5.3¢/kWh
- Maine Q1 2025: **17.80¢/kWh** (peak winter)

**HQ long-term contracts:**
- NECEC and CHPE: 6.5¢/kWh (20 years)

**MOU pricing:**
- 5.9¢/kWh starting price
- 2% annual escalation

### The Price Gap Analysis

**MOU vs HQ's own long-term contracts:**
- MOU: 5.9¢ with 2% escalation over 50 years
- HQ to New England: 6.5¢ over 20 years
- **NL giving HQ 9% discount vs what HQ charges New England**

**MOU vs actual Q1 2025 Maine prices:**
- MOU: 5.9¢ (plus future 2% escalations)
- Actual Maine: 17.80¢
- **HQ can resell Churchill Falls power for 201% profit**

**MOU escalation vs actual market increases:**
- MOU: 2% annual
- Actual (2024-2025): 114%
- **Market increasing 57× faster than MOU escalation**

---

## IMPLICATIONS FOR MOU ASSESSMENT

### What This Analysis Tells Us About the MOU

**1. Pricing mechanism inadequate:**
- Fixed 2% escalation doesn't track market
- USA markets show prices can double year-over-year
- NL locked into below-market escalation for 50 years

**2. HQ's profit margin protected:**
- Can buy from NL at 5.9¢ + 2%
- Can sell to USA at market rates (17.80¢ in Q1 2025)
- Margin increases as market prices rise faster than 2%

**3. NL missing upside participation:**
- No mechanism to capture market price spikes
- No profit sharing when HQ resells at premium
- Churchill Falls enables HQ export profits, NL doesn't benefit

**4. Comparison to alternative pricing:**
- HQ's own NECEC contract: 6.5¢ (10% higher than MOU)
- NECEC is 20 years, not 50
- Why is NL accepting worse terms for longer period?

**5. "Detached from market realities":**
- Dr. May's direct assessment
- Supported by 114% actual increase vs 2% MOU increase
- "Rapidly evolving electricity market" not reflected in MOU

---

## QUESTIONS RAISED BY THIS ANALYSIS

### For Government of Newfoundland and Labrador

**1.** Why accept 2% escalation when own reference data shows 114% increases possible?

**2.** Why accept 5.9¢ when HQ charges New England 6.5¢ for comparable power?

**3.** Why 50-year term when HQ's contracts are 20 years?

**4.** What analysis was done of market price escalation trends?

**5.** Why no profit-sharing mechanism for HQ's resale of Churchill Falls power?

### For Understanding Churchill Falls Value

**6.** If HQ can sell Churchill Falls power at 17.80¢, what is the true market value?

**7.** How much of NECEC/CHPE commitments are fulfilled with Churchill Falls power?

**8.** What would pricing look like with market-indexed escalation instead of fixed 2%?

**9.** Over 50 years, how much additional revenue would NL receive with market-based pricing?

**10.** Is "stable pricing" (2% escalation) worth giving up participation in market upside?

## DR. MAY'S CONCLUSION

### Explicit Statement

**Central finding:**
> "Do current export prices faced by HQ tell us anything about potential future price escalations? Answer: Yes, I believe so."

**Reasoning:**
- USA prices in competitive environment
- Reflect free market supply and demand dynamics
- Natural gas prices drive electricity pricing
- Market "very dynamic and will change radically over the next few years"

**Support for relevance:**
- Government of Newfoundland and Labrador uses USA prices as references
- Implicitly validates market pricing as appropriate benchmark

### Implicit Warning

**The MOU problem:**
- Fixed 2% annual escalation
- Market reality: 114% increase in one year
- "Detached from market realities, especially in the rapidly evolving electricity market"

**Translation:** NL is locking in below-market price escalation for 50 years while HQ can arbitrage into rapidly rising export markets

---

## CONTEXT FOR CHURCHILL FALLS AI AGENT

### How to Use This Analysis

**Dr. May provides:**
- Hard data on export volume collapse
- Proof of rapid price escalation (114% year-over-year)
- Evidence HQ is profit maximizer
- Comparison showing MOU's 2% escalation is inadequate

**Key points for AI agent:**
1. **Export prices matter more than export volumes** - HQ exporting less but making more profit
2. **Market prices highly volatile** - Can double year-over-year
3. **MOU's 2% fixed escalation doesn't track market** - "Detached from market realities"
4. **HQ arbitraging Churchill Falls power** - Buy cheap, sell high to USA
5. **GNL's own reference prices undermine MOU terms** - Using market prices as benchmarks, then ignoring market dynamics

### Questions Users May Ask

**"Are export prices really increasing that fast?"**
- Yes, Maine prices up 114% year-over-year (Q1 2024 to Q1 2025)
- Part due to colder winter, but increase "significantly greater than 2%"

**"Why does 2% escalation matter?"**
- Market prices can double in a year
- Over 50 years, 2% fixed rate means NL loses massive upside
- HQ can buy at MOU price, resell at market rates, keep difference

**"What would fair pricing look like?"**
- At minimum: Match HQ's own long-term contracts (6.5¢, not 5.9¢)
- Better: Index to actual USA market prices (New England ISO, New York ISO)
- Best: Profit-sharing mechanism when HQ resells Churchill Falls power at premium

**"Is the MOU pricing worse than 1969 contract?"**
- 1969: Fixed 0.2¢/kWh for 65 years (no escalation)
- MOU: Starting 5.9¢/kWh with 2% escalation for 50 years
- MOU is better than 1969, but still badly undervalues power given market dynamics
- Repeats mistake of fixed escalation instead of market-based pricing
