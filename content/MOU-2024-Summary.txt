MAIN OBJECTIVES

Terminate and replace the 1969 contract with new 51-year agreements (2025-2075). Create 50-50 revenue sharing between NL and Quebec. Develop three major expansion projects totaling approximately 3,900 MW of new capacity. Give NL access to 1,990 MW and Quebec access to a minimum of 7,200 MW.

THREE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

CF Units Upgrade (2028-2038): Upgrade all turbine-generator units. Add approximately 550 MW capacity. Cost-plus pricing with 2% annual revenue escalation.

CF Expansion Project (2035): New powerhouse adjacent to existing facility. Add approximately 1,100 MW capacity. Owned and operated by CF(L)Co. Cost-plus pricing with 2% annual escalation.

Gull Island Project (2034-2035): New hydroelectric facility 100 km southwest of Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Add approximately 2,250 MW capacity. 60% NLH ownership, 40% HQ ownership (joint venture). Half commissioned 2034, half 2035.

PRICING STRUCTURE

Existing Churchill Falls Plant: New market-based block pricing structure. Forecasted net present value of $33.8 billion in payments to CF(L)Co from HQ over the contract term. Retroactive to January 1, 2025. Dramatic improvement over 1969 rates (was approximately 0.2¢/kWh, now market-based).

New Capacity: Cost-plus pricing for all new projects. 2% per annum revenue escalation. 75% debt / 25% equity capital structure for expansions. Return on equity: 10-year Canada bonds plus 500 basis points (floor 8%, ceiling 9%).

---

TRANSMISSION

New transmission assets required in both Labrador and Quebec. NL responsible for Labrador transmission. Quebec responsible for Quebec transmission.

---

TIMELINE SUMMARY

2025: New agreements retroactively take effect. 2028-2038: CF Units Upgrade rollout. 2034: Gull Island half commissioned. 2035: CF Expansion plus remaining Gull Island capacity. 2041: Original 1969 contract expires (replaced by this MOU). 2050 and 2060: Major volume blocks expire with NL recapture options. 2075: All agreements expire.

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM 1969 CONTRACT

Market-based pricing vs. fixed low rates. 51 years vs. 65 years with automatic renewal. 50-50 revenue sharing vs. Quebec capturing vast majority. NL has recapture rights and future control options. Joint venture ownership on new developments. No automatic renewal clause.

---

ECONOMIC IMPACT

$33.8 billion NPV for existing Churchill Falls over contract term. Additional billions from new developments. 2% annual escalation ensures revenues grow with inflation. NL is intended to finally receive fair market value for electricity.
