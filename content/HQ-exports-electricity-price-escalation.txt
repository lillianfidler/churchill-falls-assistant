CENTRAL QUESTION

Do current export prices faced by HQ tell us anything about potential future price escalations? Answer: Yes.

WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HQ'S EXPORTS

There have been dramatic changes in the HQ picture with respect to the quantity of electricity exported. Exports as a percentage of total available electricity have generally been declining. Exports to other provinces in August 2025 were down almost 58% from three years earlier. Exports to the USA in August 2025 were down almost 94% from three years earlier. Exports to other provinces (NB) in 2025 are generally greater than to the USA over the year. Exports to the USA exceed those to other provinces during the winter months, when electricity prices in the northeastern USA are particularly high. Net exports to the USA are generally negative, meaning the USA imports more than it exports.

According to data from the Canada Energy Regulator, HQ appears to export to Maine and New York, but not to New England, where it has new transmission lines and agreements with the New England ISO.

PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN HQ'S EXPORTS (August):
- Total Exports: -45.4% year-over-year; -80.8% from August 2022
- Exports to Other Provinces: -29.1% year-over-year; -57.9% from August 2022
- Exports to the USA: -70.7% year-over-year; -93.7% from August 2022

HQ'S EXPORT PATTERNS

Exports seem to occur primarily in the colder winter months and also, but to a lesser extent, in the hotter summer months. Climate and climate change are important on the demand side and on the supply side (drought). Longer-term commitments to NB are beginning to dominate exports to the USA.

HQ'S SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT: COMMENTS ON EXPORT MARKETS (FIRST HALF OF 2025)

HQ stated: "The company increased electricity exports to take advantage of high prices in a context marked by strong demand." On markets outside Québec, weather conditions experienced during the first few months of the year led to an overall increase in energy prices. This was especially true in New England, Hydro-Québec's primary export market.

ESCALATING ELECTRICITY PRICES IN COMPETITIVE EXPORT MARKETS

According to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), the average price of electricity exported from Quebec to Maine in the first quarter of 2025 was $177.95 CAD/MWh (17.80¢ CAD/kWh). HQ exports more electricity when prices are high, which accounts for the high year-to-date export prices.

Export data into the same market for the same period in 2024 was 8.32¢/kWh — a 114% increase year-over-year.

Part of the increase can be attributed to the colder winter in 2025; however, the actual increase is significantly greater than the 2% increase specified in the MOU, which has a set annual rate. Those prices are detached from market realities, especially in the rapidly evolving electricity market.

EXPORTS TO OTHER PROVINCES (NEW BRUNSWICK)

HQ is involved in power projects in NB and has long-term commitments including one extending to 2040. The exports, although reflecting seasonal patterns, seem lower after 2022. There is no fixed rate for NB exports but rather a rate that reflects market conditions. To May's knowledge, these rates are not made public.

ANSWERING THE CENTRAL QUESTION

The prices in the USA are more competitive, especially for natural gas, which is needed to power turbines that produce electricity. Natural gas is the closest alternative to wind and water for HQ at present. These free markets reflect variations in demand and supply throughout the day, throughout the year, and over time. The electricity market in the USA is very dramatic and will change radically over the next few years.

Support for the relevance of using US prices is provided by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador:

REFERENCE PRICE COMPARISON TABLE:
- New York ISO YTD: 4.3¢ per kWh
- ISO New England YTD: 5.3¢ per kWh
- New CF PPA: 5.9¢ per kWh
- HQ Long-Term Contracts (NECEC and CHPE): 6.5¢ per kWh

Although the specifics of HQ's export prices to New Brunswick Power are not known, the pricing is not set during the year or over the years. Also, the long-term contract lasts until 2040; it is not for 51 years.
