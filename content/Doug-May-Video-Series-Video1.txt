EVIDENCE OF QUEBEC'S ELECTRICITY PROBLEM

Monthly data from January 2015 to June 2025 shows fairly normal electricity availability patterns in Quebec until 2023. Starting that year, drought in northern Quebec around the James Bay area began causing significant problems, primarily impacting generating projects on La Grande Riviere, including the Robert-Bourassa dam. The latest available data from June 2025 shows power levels lower than ever recorded in this period, signaling a worsening supply crisis.

DOMESTIC DEMAND PATTERNS IN QUEBEC

Quebec experiences highly seasonal electricity demand. Peak demand occurs in winter months, particularly January and February, driven by household heating needs. January 2025 demanded just over 25 million megawatt-hours. Secondary demand peaks appear in August. The annual cycle follows a consistent pattern of January peak, gradual decline, August mini-peak, decline, and then the next January peak.

Electricity producers must meet peak demands in the coldest months and maintain standby capacity for transmission line failures or generating station problems. Extended outages would be catastrophic for families relying on electricity for cooking and heating.

Multiple factors are currently increasing electricity demand: artificial intelligence data centers and cloud computing facilities requiring massive electricity, increasing electric vehicle adoption, population growth creating more households requiring power, and industrial expansion as new firms and industries locate in Canada. Demand is now requiring almost all available supply with minimal gap. Hydro-Quebec projects this situation will worsen. The core problem is that supply is going down while demand is going up.

IMPORT DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

Imports show seasonal variation, increasing in January and February and decreasing in other periods. A critical pattern break occurred in 2023-2024, with Quebec importing significantly more power than historical patterns.

Before 2023, most imported power came from other provinces with small amounts from other sources. The primary provincial source breakdown shows a small amount from Ontario, with the majority coming from Newfoundland and Labrador, specifically from Churchill Falls in Labrador rather than from Muskrat Falls, Bay d'Espoir, or other island generating capacity.

Churchill Falls Labrador Corporation (CF(L)Co) is 34.2% owned by Hydro-Quebec and 65.8% owned by Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (Nalcor). The entity importing the power partially owns the entity supplying the power.

Due to drought limiting traditional provincial sources starting in 2023, Quebec now also imports significant power from the United States, primarily New York. Hydro-Quebec continues exporting to the United States while simultaneously importing significant power from there. March 2025 showed particularly heavy imports from New York.

QUEBEC'S GENERATION CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Total utility generation in Quebec shows seasonal patterns as expected but with a declining trend due to drought. Historically over 90% of Quebec's generation came from hydroelectric sources. This percentage is declining due to drought, with wind power increasingly filling the gap. However, wind power is more expensive than hydro power.

Hydro-Quebec's argument for low electricity prices to households and aluminum refineries depends on cheap hydro power from large generating stations. The output from these stations is declining.

CHURCHILL FALLS' CONTRIBUTION TO QUEBEC

Churchill Falls provides approximately 17% of Quebec's available electricity, assuming about 90% of total Churchill Falls power goes to Quebec and about 10% is used by Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro.

For comparison, the Robert-Bourassa dam has higher rated capacity than Churchill Falls but produces less actual annual power, running at approximately 78% capacity utilization. Newfoundland and Labrador's total generation, including Churchill Falls, shows a fairly constant pattern with no significant decline like Quebec's generation.

PROPOSED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS UNDER THE MOU

Churchill Falls power is extremely cheap and hydro power costs less than wind power. Quebec needs additional cheap hydro capacity. Three major projects are proposed under the MOU.

The Gull Island Project is a completely new development with capacity of 2,250 megawatts per hour, representing the largest new capacity addition. The Churchill Falls Upgrade would replace existing turbines with 11 new turbines, adding 550 megawatts per hour through modernization of existing infrastructure. The Churchill Falls Extension would add 2 new turbines for an additional 1,100 megawatts per hour.

Total new or upgraded capacity across all three projects would be 3,900 megawatts per hour.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Quebec's electricity generation is declining due to drought affecting James Bay hydro facilities while multiple factors including AI, electric vehicles, population growth, and industrial expansion are increasing demand. This convergence creates a critical shortage. Quebec is increasingly dependent on imports, now including power from New York, which reverses the traditional export relationship.

Churchill Falls currently provides 17% of Quebec's electricity and maintains stable production while Quebec's own generation declines. Quebec's competitive advantage of low electricity prices depends on cheap hydro power that is increasingly scarce. The proposed 3,900 MW of new or upgraded capacity at Churchill Falls directly addresses Quebec's urgent need for additional cheap hydroelectric power.

KEY STATISTICS

Total electricity available to Quebec: Declining since 2023 due to drought. Churchill Falls contribution to Quebec: approximately 17% of available electricity. Robert-Bourassa capacity utilization: approximately 78%. Proposed new or upgraded capacity under MOU: 3,900 MW total, comprising Gull Island at 2,250 MW, Churchill Falls Upgrade at 550 MW, and Churchill Falls Extension at 1,100 MW.

METHODOLOGY: Analysis based on Statistics Canada monthly data from January 2015 to June 2025, Hydro-Quebec reports and projections, generation and import/export data, and comparative analysis of hydro versus wind power costs.
