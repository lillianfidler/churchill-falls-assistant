---

## FACTORS AFFECTING 2024 PERFORMANCE

### Temperature Impact (Negative)

**Effect on sales:** -1.2 TWh or -$107 million (compared to 2023)

**Key fact:** 2024 temperatures in Quebec were warmest on record

**Winter 2023-2024:** For almost 90% of days, temperatures were above climate normals
- **First quarter:** Most pronounced impact - decrease of 1.5 TWh or $135 million
- **February:** On average 4°C higher than previous year
- **Fourth quarter:** Slightly colder than 2023 - increase of 0.4 TWh or $40 million

**Note:** Heating accounts for vast majority of electricity consumption during winter months, so temperature rises have unfavorable impact on sales

### Water Inflow (Negative)

**Status:** Below-normal natural water inflows for second year in a row

**Impact:** Contributed significantly to decline in net income

### Baseload Demand (Positive)

**Increase:** +1.1 TWh or +$118 million

**Factors:**
- Increased energy needs in residential segment
- Growth in commercial, institutional, and small industrial segment
- Demographic change leading to growth in customer accounts
- **Note:** Mitigated by slight downturn in demand in several large industrial customer segments

**Additional factor:** 2024 was leap year (February 29) - additional day of sales

### Rate Indexations (Positive)

**Effect:** +$508 million in revenue

**April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2024 indexations:**
- Domestic rates: Capped at 3%
- Business customer rates: +5.1%
- Large-power industrial rate (Rate L): +3.3%

### Aluminum Prices (Positive)

**Effect:** +$53 million in revenue from electricity sales in Quebec

**Reason:** Aluminum prices affect revenue from some special contracts

---

## EXPORT MARKET PERFORMANCE

### 2024 Export Sales

**Volume:** 15.1 TWh
**Revenue:** $2.365 billion
**Average price:** 9.9¢/kWh

### Comparison to 2023

**Revenue change:** -$866 million (significant decrease)

**Context:** 2023 had "record levels" for average price obtained on external markets due to "skilful deployment of hedging strategy"

**Implication:** 2024 represented a return to more normal export pricing after exceptional 2023 performance
