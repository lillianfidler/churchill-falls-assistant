GLOBAL AND QUEBEC CONTEXT

Hydro-Quebec states that the global race has begun, with countries rapidly accelerating decarbonization investments. In 2022, $1.6 trillion was invested in energy transition globally, with over $40 trillion announced worldwide by 2030 and the United States alone committing over $660 billion per year from now to 2035.

Hydro-Quebec states Quebec has a head start in this race due to hydropower investments. Residential electricity rates are the lowest in the G7, and industrial rates are at least two times lower than virtually all western countries. Quebec's current energy mix is 42% electricity, 50% fossil fuels, and 8% biofuel, meaning 50% of Quebec's consumption still uses fossil fuel-based energy. The goal is carbon neutrality by 2050.

The electrification challenge is significant: over 90% of cars consume gas, many thousands of buildings are heated with gas or oil, and some factories still use coal. All must be converted to electricity for carbon neutrality.

ENERGY TRANSITION OBJECTIVES

Hydro-Quebec projects Quebec's electricity consumption will double by 2050, with a total increase of 150-200 TWh. Of new generation, 75% would be dedicated to decarbonization and 25% for economic growth.

By 2035, additional use breaks down as 40% for transportation electrification and building decarbonization, 35% for industrial decarbonization, and 25% for economic growth. Hydro-Quebec states that clean electricity will be the driving force of the energy transition, describing it as Quebec's next big society-wide endeavour.

SPECIFIC ENERGY AND CAPACITY NEEDS BY 2035

Additional energy needed is 60 TWh by 2035, in addition to 13 TWh or 1,800 MW already included in the November 2022 Electricity Supply Plan. Additional capacity needed is 8,000-9,000 MW by 2035. Hydro-Quebec compares this to the installed capacity of three of their largest hydropower facilities: Robert-Bourassa (LG-2), Manic-5, and the Romaine complex.

Planned sources for additional energy by 2035: improved consumption and efficiency at 7-9 TWh, wind power at 30-35 TWh, hydropower at 6-8 TWh, and other sources including imports, solar, battery, and renewable natural gas at 6-10 TWh, totalling 60 TWh.

Planned sources for additional capacity by 2035: improved consumption and efficiency at 1,600-1,800 MW, wind power at 1,500-1,700 MW, hydropower at 3,800-4,200 MW, other sources including imports, solar, and battery at 500-1,000 MW, and renewable natural gas at 400-600 MW, totalling 8,000-9,000 MW.

CRITICAL STATEMENTS ABOUT ENERGY SOURCES

On wind and solar as variable generation, Hydro-Quebec states these are the most advantageous options for rapid rollout, cost, and social acceptability. However, electricity generated by variable sources fluctuates as it depends on weather conditions such as wind force and sunlight, and these solutions alone are not enough because wind and customer behaviour cannot be controlled.

On hydropower as firm generation, Hydro-Quebec states it is the best choice by far, defining firm generation as sufficient electricity from sources like hydropower that can be mobilized as needed to ensure reliability of power supply especially during peak periods. They provide the scenario of a cold and windless winter day when thousands of households turn up the heat and start preparing supper, when capacity needs are at their highest.

The strategic statement is that the strategy must include sufficient hydropower capacity to meet demand when energy efficiency and wind power are not enough.

THE FIVE PRIORITIES

Priority 1 is to improve service quality by increasing investments in the power grid for reliable, high-quality service at an affordable price. Hydro-Quebec acknowledges that 2023 was one of the worst years in the last 15 for power outages, and time to connect new customers increased nearly 70% since 2019.

Priority 2 is to help customers use electricity wisely by innovating to encourage customers to treat electricity as a valuable resource, focusing on energy efficiency measures, peak demand management, and customer behaviour modification.

Priority 3 is to increase power generation capacity by identifying and launching the best projects to generate more electricity while remaining open to all available options. This encompasses the 60 TWh and 8,000-9,000 MW targets.

Priority 4 is to partner with Indigenous communities by working towards economic reconciliation with First Nations and Inuit. Key initiatives include financial partnerships in new energy projects, economic participation of Indigenous communities in infrastructure on ancestral lands, collaboration in project development phases, and increased Indigenous representation. The Hertel-New York Interconnection Line partnership with the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake is provided as an example.

Priority 5 is to become agile, innovative, and transparent by transforming ways of doing things, simplifying processes, accelerating project development, finding innovative solutions, addressing labour shortage and supply problems, and collaborating with some of the largest companies in the global energy sector.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

Total required investments and expenses to 2035: investments for reliability projects at $90-110 billion ($7-9 billion annually), investments for growth projects at $45-50 billion ($4-5 billion annually), and additional operating expenses at $20-25 billion ($1-2 billion annually), for a total of $155-185 billion ($12-16 billion annually). Hydro-Quebec states this is three to four times higher than the annual average of the past five years.

The stated economic impact will mobilize an average of 35,000 construction workers per year until 2035, and the positive impact of the energy sector on Quebec's GDP could exceed $100 billion by 2035.

Hydro-Quebec commits to work with government to limit rate increases while maintaining affordable rates for households and competitive rates for businesses worldwide.

POWER GRID CRISIS AND URGENT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

Hydro-Quebec acknowledges that climate change is having a very real impact on the power grid and affecting customers' daily lives, with declining service quality and 2023 being one of the worst years in the last 15 for power outages. Causes include extreme weather events such as ice storms and forest fires causing more frequent and longer outages, aging infrastructure commissioned decades ago approaching end of useful life, and climate change testing the resilience of facilities.

Hydro-Quebec is determined to reduce power outages by 35% over the next 7 to 10 years. Grid investment of $45-50 billion between now and 2035 is required, representing $4-5 billion annually and almost doubling annual investments made in network sustainability over the last three years.

Specific improvements planned include deploying new equipment in the distribution system such as composite poles and conductor covers, adopting innovative practices like direct or light burial of power lines, stepping up vegetation control to reduce outages by 30% by 2028 since 40% of outages are caused by vegetation contact with power lines, enhanced grid robustness and modernization, and building a strong foundation to handle growing demand.

CUSTOMER BASE AND COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS

For residential customers, the focus is on energy efficiency equipment such as heat pumps and smart thermostats, with a goal of 700,000 high-efficiency systems installed by 2035, increasing from 3% to 25% of Quebec homes with such equipment. Rate offerings will encourage behaviour changes.

Business and commercial customers receive customized advice and support from commercial delegates and engineers. Small and medium-sized businesses will receive help to reduce energy consumption by 10%.

Large industrial customers benefit from customized advice and support for high-performance industrial processes and building automation systems, with industrial rates at least two times lower than virtually all western countries.

Hydro-Quebec's customer expansion goal is recruiting one million new users within five years for business customer tools.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION

Hydro-Quebec plans to make better use of digital technologies for more proactive, user-friendly customer communications adapted to preferences, including better user interfaces, enriched content on platforms, additional communication channels such as text messages and email notifications, targeted notices regarding possible outages, anticipated service restoration times in the Outage Tracker, and regular updates about service restoration.

Hydro-Quebec commits to collaborate with peers, the academic community, and the private sector to identify and rapidly integrate innovations. Priority will be targeting innovations that reduce pressure on energy and capacity balances. The possible use of locally developed technologies will allow Quebec businesses to showcase their skills.

Technology options Hydro-Quebec will remain open to include wind farms, hydroelectric generating stations, solar power, battery storage, pumped-storage generating stations, renewable thermal energy including biofuels, green hydrogen, and renewable natural gas, small modular reactors currently under development, and imports from neighbouring markets.

CONTEXT FOR CHURCHILL FALLS (IMPLICIT)

While Churchill Falls is not explicitly mentioned in the Action Plan 2035, the document establishes Hydro-Quebec's specific need for 3,800-4,200 MW of new hydropower capacity by 2035, its stated preference for hydropower as the best choice by far for reliability, its identification of hydropower as firm generation that can be mobilized as needed, its strategic challenge with variable generation from wind and solar not being sufficient alone, its massive investment requirements of $155-185 billion to 2035, its commitment to maintaining competitive rates while meeting growing demand, and its positioning in global energy markets.

Churchill Falls provides approximately 5,400 MW of hydropower capacity, which exceeds Hydro-Quebec's entire identified need for new hydropower capacity of 3,800-4,200 MW by 2035.
