RECAP FROM VIDEO 1

Most electricity imports to Quebec come from Newfoundland and Labrador. Recently, imports have increased from the United States due to drought around the James Bay area of Quebec. This video focuses on pricing mechanisms and cost structures.

CURRENT ELECTRICITY PRICES TO HOUSEHOLDS

Montreal residential rates as of April 2025 use a tiered pricing structure. The first 1,200 kWh per month costs 6.678 cents per kWh, and usage above 1,200 kWh per month costs 10.153 cents per kWh, plus a monthly basic charge. For an average Quebec household using 1,550 kWh per month, the effective rate is 8.30 cents per kWh including the basic charge.

By comparison, St. John's Newfoundland at the same 1,550 kWh usage has an effective rate of 15.022 cents per kWh including the basic charge. St. John's is 80% more expensive than Montreal.

Under the new agreement with the Quebec government, prices can increase up to 3% annually over the next 5 years, after which a mandatory review is required.

DYNAMIC PRICING

Dynamic pricing varies based on time of day and season. Daily variation means higher prices during peak hours such as morning breakfast time and evening dinner time, with lower prices during off-peak hours, encouraging consumers to shift usage. Seasonal variation follows the same principle as Airbnb prices increasing in summer or airline tickets costing more at Christmas, with electricity prices higher in winter and lower in spring and summer. Hydro-Quebec is actively promoting this dynamic pricing model.

COMPARATIVE PRICING ACROSS CANADA AND G7

Using a price index with Montreal as the baseline of 100, Winnipeg sits at 131, St. John's at 180 (80% more expensive), and Toronto at 187. U.S. cities like Boston and San Francisco are significantly higher still. Montreal has the cheapest electricity prices in Canada and among G7 countries. Cheap electricity is a core part of Quebec's industrial strategy.

WHY QUEBEC PRICES ARE SO LOW

Hydro-Quebec is a government-owned Crown Corporation that operates as a cost minimizer rather than a profit maximizer. As a regulated monopolist and the only supplier, it sets prices for residential consumers and uses variable or negotiated pricing for industrial customers based on size, timing of usage, and other factors. Its essential service mandate means public interest takes priority over profit maximization.

A key economic consideration involves equalization payments. Any profit from the Crown Corporation counts as provincial revenue, which affects federal equalization payments under the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. Quebec economists analyzing this in the late 1990s identified a "rent dissipation" strategy: keep prices as low as possible to avoid making substantial profit, which results in lower provincial revenue and therefore higher equalization payments from the federal government.

ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN QUEBEC

Over 90% of power generated in Quebec comes from hydroelectric stations. This percentage is decreasing due to continuing drought into 2025, though it remains above 90%. Wind power plays an increasingly larger role, filling the gap left by declining hydro generation.

ROBERT-BOURASSA GENERATING STATION

Located on La Grande Riviere (formerly called LG-2), Robert-Bourassa has a slightly higher rated capacity than Churchill Falls but does not run at full capacity year-round. Churchill Falls typically runs at 72% capacity utilization while Robert-Bourassa runs at approximately 78%, producing actual annual output of 29,600 megawatt-hours, which is less total output than Churchill Falls despite the higher rated capacity.

The industry views reservoirs like Robert-Bourassa and Smallwood at Churchill Falls as huge storage batteries. Water release can be timed strategically: release more during high-demand or high-price periods, and conserve during low-demand or low-price periods.

COST STRUCTURE AND THE CF(L)Co OWNERSHIP FACTOR

Average cost of electricity varies from station to station, and transmission costs must be added on top. A critical pricing consideration involves CF(L)Co ownership. Hydro-Quebec owns 34.2% of CF(L)Co, so when media discusses prices CF(L)Co receives, one must remember that to the extent of 34.2%, Hydro-Quebec is effectively paying itself. Some characterize this as Hydro-Quebec having "captured" or "holding hostage" CF(L)Co.

The La Grande Riviere complex includes multiple dams: Robert-Bourassa (LG-2), LG-2A adjacent to Robert-Bourassa, LG-3, LG-1, and several others. The drought affecting generation is occurring in this James Bay area.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

Historically, Churchill Falls operators hoped to get a transmission line through Quebec. Premier Joey Smallwood sought this route, but Quebec would not allow it. While this could have been forced under the British North America Act, Ottawa discouraged Smallwood from pursuing it.

Electricity delivery involves three cost levels: generation costs at the dam or station, transmission costs on large high-voltage lines such as from Muskrat Falls to Soldiers Pond distribution site in the St. John's area, and distribution costs for local delivery to neighbourhoods and individual homes including poles and underground lines. In St. John's, local distribution is handled by Newfoundland Power, a Fortis subsidiary.

ECONOMIC COST ANALYSIS

Hydro-Quebec's official explanation for low prices is the use of hydropower rather than fossil fuels, described as "cheap green energy," though there is an environmental caveat that cement in dams is not environmentally friendly during construction even though operating hydroelectric facilities are clean.

The economic production function for hydroelectric generation includes capital stock (dams, turbines, infrastructure), labour services, purchased energy, purchased materials, purchased supplies, and critically, water. Unlike standard manufacturing where labour and capital are primary inputs, water is the key input that makes hydro viable. Capital provides a flow of services rather than being consumed, and this flow decreases during drought as less water through turbines means lower utilization and decreased productivity.

Economists use economic costs rather than accounting costs, which includes the return on capital as a cost alongside prices for capital services, labour, energy, materials, supplies, and water royalties. Average cost equals total cost divided by quantity of output.

WATER PRICING IN QUEBEC

Before approximately 2015, water may have been considered a free good in Quebec. Modern environmental economics recognizes water as a scarce resource that is apparently not sustainable as demonstrated by drought, carries an environmental cost, and creates a social cost where electricity priced too cheaply encourages inefficient household usage. Quebec's current water royalty rate is 0.75% of total revenue generated from sale of hydroelectricity.

COST CALCULATIONS FOR GENERATING STATIONS

The Robert-Bourassa and other La Grande stations have an average accounting cost of $50-70 per megawatt-hour, equivalent to 5-7 cents per kWh. Dr. May notes this seems relatively high. Large hydro stations are relatively inexpensive, other hydro facilities moderate, and wind farms more expensive than hydro.

Drought increases average costs because fixed costs remain constant (dams, turbines, and labour cannot be sent home during low production months) while the variable input of water availability decreases. The same fixed costs divided by lower output equals higher average cost per kWh.

Churchill Falls has an average cost of $2.95 per megawatt-hour, equivalent to 0.295 cents per kWh, assuming 90% of output goes to Quebec. Churchill Falls supplies 31,050,000 megawatt-hours annually to Quebec. Churchill Falls is approximately 17-24 times cheaper than La Grande generation.
