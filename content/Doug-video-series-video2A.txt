## RECAP FROM VIDEO 1

- Most electricity imports to Quebec come from Newfoundland and Labrador
- Recently, imports have increased from the United States
- Reason: Drought around James Bay area of Quebec
- Today's focus: Pricing mechanisms and cost structures

## CURRENT ELECTRICITY PRICES TO HOUSEHOLDS

### Montreal Residential Rates (As of April 2025)

**Tiered pricing structure:**
- First 1,200 kWh per month: 6.678 cents per kWh
- Above 1,200 kWh per month: 10.153 cents per kWh
- Plus: Monthly basic charge

**Average household calculation:**
- Assumption: 1,550 kWh per month (average Quebec household usage)
- **Effective rate: 8.30 cents per kWh** (including basic charge)

### Comparative Analysis: Montreal vs. St. John's

**St. John's, NL (same 1,550 kWh usage):**
- **Effective rate: 15.022 cents per kWh** (including basic charge)
- Actual per-kWh rate slightly less, but basic charge brings total to 15.022 cents

**Price differential: St. John's is 80% more expensive than Montreal**

### Future Pricing Agreement
- Under new agreement with Quebec government
- Prices can increase up to 3% annually over next 5 years
- After 5 years: mandatory review required

---

## DYNAMIC PRICING CONCEPT

### What is Dynamic Pricing?
**Definition:** Pricing that varies based on time of day and/or season

**Daily variation:**
- Higher prices during peak hours (morning breakfast time, evening dinner time)
- Lower prices during off-peak hours
- Encourages consumers to shift usage to off-peak periods

**Seasonal variation:**
- Similar to Airbnb prices increasing in summer (high demand)
- Similar to airline tickets costing more at Christmas
- Electricity prices higher in winter, lower in spring/summer

**Hydro-Québec is actively promoting this dynamic pricing model**

---

## COMPARATIVE PRICING: CANADA AND G7

### Price Index Comparison (Montreal = 100)

**Canadian Cities (2024-2025 data):**
- Montreal: 100 (baseline)
- Winnipeg: 131
- St. John's: 180 (80% more expensive)
- Toronto: 187

**U.S. Cities:**
- Boston: Significantly higher than Montreal
- San Francisco: Highest of all cities examined

**KEY FINDING: Montreal has the cheapest electricity prices in Canada and among the G7 countries**

**Strategic importance:** Cheap electricity prices are a core part of Quebec's industrial strategy

---

## WHY ARE QUEBEC PRICES SO LOW?

### Hydro-Québec's Corporate Structure and Strategy

**Ownership:** Government-owned Crown Corporation

**Primary objective:** Cost minimizer (not profit maximizer)

**Operational model:**
- Regulated monopolist (only supplier)
- Set prices for residential consumers
- Variable/negotiated prices for industrial customers based on:
  - Size of customer
  - Timing of electricity usage
  - Other factors

**Essential service mandate:**
- Provides essential good (electricity) to households who need it
- Public interest takes priority over profit maximization

### The Equalization Payment Strategy

**Key economic consideration:**
- Any profit from Crown Corporation counts as provincial revenue
- Provincial revenue affects federal equalization payments under Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act

**Quebec economist analysis (late 1990s):**
- Quebec's advantage: "Dissipate the rents"
- Strategy: Keep prices as low as possible
- Goal: Don't make substantial profit (to maximize equalization payments from federal government)
- Result: Lower provincial revenue = higher equalization payments

**Economic term:** "Rent dissipation" strategy

---

## ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN QUEBEC

### Hydroelectric Dominance
- **Over 90% of power generated comes from hydroelectric stations**
- This percentage is decreasing due to continuing drought (into 2025)
- Still above 90%, but trending downward
- Wind power plays increasingly larger role (filling the gap)

---

## ROBERT-BOURASSA GENERATING STATION

### Scale and Capacity
**Location:** La Grande Rivière (formerly called LG-2)

**Capacity:**
- Slightly higher rated capacity than Churchill Falls
- However, doesn't run at full capacity year-round

### Capacity Utilization Analysis

**Churchill Falls:**
- Typically runs at 72% capacity utilization over the year

**Robert-Bourassa:**
- Runs at approximately 78% capacity utilization
- Actual annual output: 29,600 [units]
- **Less total output than Churchill Falls despite higher rated capacity**

### The Reservoir as "Storage Battery" Concept
**Industry perspective:**
- Reservoirs (Robert-Bourassa, Smallwood at Churchill Falls) viewed as huge storage batteries
- Water release can be timed strategically
- Release more water during high-demand/high-price periods
- Conserve water during low-demand/low-price periods

---

## COST STRUCTURE CONSIDERATIONS

### Average Cost Variation
- **Average cost of electricity varies from station to station**
- Plus: Transmission costs must be added

### The CF(L)Co Ownership Factor

**Critical pricing consideration:**
- CF(L)Co owns and operates Churchill Falls
- Hydro-Québec owns 34.2% of CF(L)Co

**Effective price calculation:**
- When media discusses prices CF(L)Co receives, must remember:
- Hydro-Québec's perspective: Effective price it pays
- **To the extent of 34.2%, Hydro-Québec is "paying itself"**

**Some characterize this as:** Hydro-Québec has "captured" or is "holding hostage" CF(L)Co

---

## LA GRANDE RIVIÈRE COMPLEX

### Multiple Dams on La Grande
- Robert-Bourassa (LG-2)
- LG-2A (adjacent to Robert-Bourassa, essentially same dam)
- LG-3
- LG-1
- Multiple other dams along La Grande Rivière

**Drought location:** Occurring in this James Bay area where these dams are located

---

## TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

### Historical Context: Churchill Falls Transmission
- Originally hoped to get transmission line through Quebec
- Premier Joey Smallwood sought this route
- Quebec wouldn't allow it
- Could have been forced under British North America Act
- Ottawa discouraged Smallwood from pursuing this

### Cost Components
**Three levels of electricity delivery costs:**

1. **Generation costs:** At the dam/station
2. **Transmission costs:** Large high-voltage lines (e.g., from Muskrat Falls to Soldiers Pond distribution site in St. John's area)
3. **Distribution costs:** Local delivery to neighborhoods and individual homes
   - Poles on property or underground lines
   - Local distribution infrastructure
   - In St. John's: Handled by Newfoundland Power (Fortis subsidiary)

---

## ECONOMIC COST ANALYSIS

### Why Hydro-Québec Achieves Low Prices

**Official Hydro-Québec answer:**
- Use of hydropower (not fossil fuels)
- **"Cheap green energy"**

**Environmental caveat:**
- Once operating, hydroelectric is clean
- However: Cement in dams not environmentally friendly during construction

---

## PRODUCTION FUNCTION AND COST MINIMIZATION

### Economic Framework (Microeconomics)

**Production Function:**
Q = f(K, L, E, M, S, W)

Where:
- Q = Output (electricity)
- K = Capital stock (dams, turbines, infrastructure)
- L = Labor services
- E = Purchased energy
- M = Purchased materials
- S = Purchased supplies (phone services, etc.)
- **W = WATER** (the critical input for hydro)

### Key Difference from Manufacturing
**Standard production:** Labor and capital are primary inputs

**Hydroelectric production:**
- **Water (W) is the key input that makes hydro viable**
- Capital provides "flow of services" (not consumed)
- Labor provides services (not "used up")
- **Critical point:** Flow of services from capital (dams/turbines) decreases during drought
- Less water through turbines = lower utilization = decreased productivity

### Economic Costs vs. Accounting Costs

**Economic costs (used by economists):**
- Include return on capital as a cost
- Broader than traditional accounting costs
- Include opportunity cost of capital

**Components with prices:**
- PK = Price of capital services
- PL = Price of labor services
- PE = Price of energy
- PM = Price of materials
- PS = Price of supplies
- **PW = Price of water** (royalty/rent)

**Total Economic Cost = (PK × K) + (PL × L) + (PE × E) + (PM × M) + (PS × S) + (PW × W)**

**Average Cost = Total Cost / Q (Quantity of output)**

### Return to Capital
- Included in economic costs (not in accounting costs)
- Could be bonds
- Could be shareholder expectations
- Could be other entrepreneurial investment returns

## WATER PRICING IN QUEBEC

### Historical Context
- Before ~2015: Water may have been considered a "free good" in Quebec

### Modern Environmental Economics Perspective
**Recognition of scarcity:**
- Water is a scarce resource
- Apparently not sustainable (drought demonstrates this)
- Environmental cost to using water
- **Social cost:** If electricity too cheap, encourages inefficient use (households use too much)

### Current Water Royalty System

**Quebec's water royalty rate:**
- **0.75% of total revenue generated from sale of hydro-electricity**
- Applied to electricity generated and sold in Quebec
- Recognizes water as a resource with value

## COST CALCULATIONS FOR GENERATING STATIONS

### La Grande Complex Average Accounting Cost

**Robert-Bourassa and other La Grande stations:**
- Average accounting cost: **$50-70 per megawatt-hour**
- Equivalent to: **5-7 cents per kilowatt-hour**

**Dr. May's note:** "Seems relatively high to me"

### Cost Structure by Type
**Ranking (low to high cost):**
1. Large hydro stations (La Grande complex): Relatively inexpensive
2. Other hydro facilities: Moderate
3. Wind farms: More expensive than hydro

### Impact of Drought on Average Costs

**Fixed costs remain constant:**
- Capital costs (dams, turbines already built)
- Labor costs (can't send workers home for a month during low production)
- Other purchased costs

**Variable input decreases:**
- Water availability going down

**Result: Average cost per kWh INCREASES**
- Same fixed costs ÷ lower output = higher average cost
- This is happening at Robert-Bourassa and other La Grande dams

---

## CHURCHILL FALLS COST COMPARISON

### Churchill Falls Average Cost

**Calculation basis:**
- Average cost: **$2.95 per megawatt-hour**
- Equivalent to: **0.295 cents per kilowatt-hour**

**Assumption for Quebec:**
- 90% of Churchill Falls power goes to Quebec
- 10% used by Newfoundland and Labrador

**Imported energy from Churchill Falls to Quebec:**
- **31,050,000 megawatt-hours annually** (the 90% portion)

### Comparative Analysis: Churchill Falls vs. La Grande

**La Grande complex:** 5-7 cents per kWh
**Churchill Falls:** 0.295 cents per kWh

**Churchill Falls is approximately 17-24 times cheaper than La Grande generation**

---

## DYNAMIC PRICING IN PRACTICE

### Seasonal Price Variation
- Costs relatively fixed (capital, labor, infrastructure)
- **Prices vary up and down seasonally**
- Higher in winter (peak demand)
- Lower in summer (lower demand)

**Note:** Dr. May acknowledges diagram may not be optimal but illustrates the concept

**Full dynamic pricing analysis:** Will be covered in Video 3 (dealing with import/export prices rather than set domestic prices)

---

## AGGREGATE COST CALCULATION METHOD

### Total System Cost Calculation

**Formula:**
1. Add up costs from ALL generating stations
2. Sum = Grand Total Cost
3. Divide by total power generated (total Q)
4. Result = Average cost per kWh for entire system

### Fixed Cost Reality
**Key economic point:**
- Costs from generating stations are relatively fixed
- Dam exists whether running or not
- Turbines exist whether running or not
- **Cannot lay off workers seasonally** ("You can't say: now you guys can go off and do something else... Take a month off because it's now March")
- **Costs still incurred even when producing less electricity**

---

## KEY MESSAGE FROM VIDEO 2A

### Answer to Central Question: Why Are Electricity Costs So Low?

**Primary reason:** Use of hydro-generated electricity

**Specifically:**
- Most productive hydro stations in Quebec are on La Grande Rivière
- Robert-Bourassa is the "really big one"
- Large generating stations benefit from **economies of scale**
- More water flow capacity = lower per-unit costs
- Even somewhat smaller hydro stations benefit from the inherent cost advantages of hydroelectric generation

**Bottom line:** It's hydroelectricity that provides the fundamental cost advantage

2. Why does Hydro-Québec need:
   - The Churchill Falls upgrade?
   - The Churchill Falls enlargement?
