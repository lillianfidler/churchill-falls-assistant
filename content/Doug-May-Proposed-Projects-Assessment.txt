The Assessment of the
Proposed Projects
Under the MOU

Initial Statement
• In January of 2025, Dr. Wade Locke released an in-depth
“Assessment” of the Dec. 12, 2024, MOU between the
governments of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador. In his
assessment, Wade was constrained by the information contained
in the MOU or publicly available. In all similar matters, including
my analysis, readers must take into consideration the accuracy or
reliability of the data provided or publicly available.
• Accordingly, Dr. Wade Locke wrote in his conclusion, “There is not
sufficient information in the MOU to thoroughly evaluate all, or
any, of the proposed new developments.” Source: W. Locke, An
Assessment of the December 12, 2024, Churchill Falls MOU
between Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec, Jan. 2025,
p.19.

• Having thoroughly reviewed the material, I agree with Wade’s
statement. My analysis has been heavily limited by the lack of critical
data or the potential unreliability of such data. My attempts to obtain
the necessary data, which I believe are essential for an accurate
assessment, from Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro have been
unsuccessful. I am unsure of the reason for this. The key point is that
we need more information to properly evaluate the proposed
infrastructure projects outlined in the MOU using accepted
professional standards.
• Some of the missing information includes prices for the electricity
outputs of Gull Island or the CF Enlargement. Surprisingly, the CF
Upgrade is included in the existing prices. Also absent is any data on
operating costs and their timing. We are not informed about the
expected lifespan of the infrastructure projects. As a result, net present
value analysis or cost-benefit analysis cannot be performed. Among
the input costs, the suggestion of any increase in water rents or
royalties is ignored in the MOU, although NLH has informed me that
such rates are being “modernized”.

• Although we have been notified that the prices for existing power are
forecasted, they are presented as being certainty-equivalent base
prices. In other words, the prices might be higher, but they will not be
lower. Implicit is that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians do not care
about the risks associated with hydro projects. If there are cost
overruns, HQ may accept the additional costs. Could costs be lower?
Could financing costs of debt be higher for the Government of
Newfoundland and Labrador?
• One of the greatest risks that might affect any new hydro developments
are changes in water levels and flows due to climate change.
Decreasing water flows have recently been a major problem for HQ.
Has the same drought phenomenon affected the Churchill River
system, which is further to the east of Quebec’s La Grande generating
stations? Hydraulic electricity generation in NL from January to July
2025 is 15% lower than in the same period in 2024.

• The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, in its publication
Our Chapter (Slide 9), states with respect to the proposed Gull
Island hydro project that “Environmental Assessment (EA) in
2012, following extensive and rigorous environmental review,” was
conducted. Okay, but in 2021, did HQ forecast that electricity
production would decline from 2023 onwards?
• I argue that there are risks, and the public does care about future
risks, especially when they or their children (future generations)
are on the hook for such costs.
• A lot has happened in our economy since December 2024. Have
tariffs affected any of the development costs estimates?

• Although the projects are separated in the MOU, in economic
analysis, Gull Island cannot be separated from the proposed
transmission line.
• The GNL’s Fact Sheet’s reference to an average of 3,000 annual
jobs over up to 11 years sounds enticing. Much more detail is
needed regarding occupational details, related compensation,
and timelines. Labour markets will likely be very tight given the
current emphasis on large infrastructure projects. It is quite
possible that most jobs will not go to individuals in local or
regional labour markets.
• Given the above, a cost-benefit analysis must be conducted to
determine which groups will see their economic well-being
increase from the development and operation of these proposed
projects.

• In the MOU, we are told that the three proposed generating projects are
to be financed by 25% equity and 75% debt. The transmission line is
entirely the responsibility of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (NLH).
The table below from Locke provides more detail.
• To be clear, while the debt is the responsibility of NLH, its debt
obligations are guaranteed by the Government of Newfoundland and
Labrador (GNL).
• I concur with Wade Locke that the potential direct debt of some 17
billion dollars, and the potential additional financial obligations
associated with the CF upgrade and the transmission lines, are very
substantial. Indeed, given the primary use of the additional power for
Quebec households and industries (as part of an industrial strategy) it
is not clear to me why the NL public would want to continue the
subsidization of low-cost electricity for Quebec.

Financing the Projects
• Locke writes:
HQ purchases 40% of the equity in Gull Island for $4.8 B nominal
dollars, which is equivalent to $3.5 B in present value terms, with a
5.8% discount rate and 2024 as the base year. The debt equity
structure for this project and the other development projects is 25%
equity and 75% debt.

HQ’s Profit-Maximizing Strategy
• Claudine Bouchard, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hydro-
Québec was recently quoted in the Montreal Gazette as saying, “At
some point, they’re (northeastern U.S. markets) going to need energy
because of the data centres and all that, so this new energy economy
will be very different in the next decade, so we have to prepare for that
in order to get all the opportunities that we can get from that new
market.”
• So, is HQ's profit-making strategy to buy cheap electric power from a
company, namely CF(L)Co or Gull Island, in which you are a substantial
minority shareholder, and sell it into U.S. markets at much higher
prices? My other video on proposed prices for existing power shows
that export prices for power are highest in the winter months.

• The table below tells us a lot. Locke estimates the current load
factor from Churchill Falls to be about 72%, and this appears to
be consistent with Parsons’ forecasted prices. Newfoundland and
Labrador Hydro and Hydro-Québec estimate the average annual
load of the 3 projects to be just shy of 40%.
• Hydro-Québec’s sensible strategy is to generate the most
electricity in the winter, when it is most needed by Quebec
households and other users, and when it can be exported or re-
exported (using Churchill Falls electricity) into New England and
New York.
• To forecast annual loads, HQ and NLH have forecast electricity
generation daily and monthly. Once again, independent reviewers
will need to make such data available to the public.

Gull Island 2250 MWh 12.0 TWh 60.88%
CF Expansion 1100 MWh 0.4 TWh 4.15%
CF Upgrade 500 MWh 1.0 TWh 22.83%
These estimated load factors imply winter usage when higher prices
prevail in U.S. markets.

Some observations and questions:
• To what extent does the NL public want NLH to be a profit-making
enterprise (PME)?
• There are challenges if it does, since it is selling power to a
primarily cost-minimizing public utility that is buying power from a
company in which it is a substantial shareholder.
• Are the projected costs subject to change because of changes in
purchased imported capital goods, such as turbines?
• As Locke correctly points out, Net Present Value (NPV) estimates
for these projects would require project timelines with detailed
projected costs, including capital costs and other costs such as
labour, with alternative scenarios. Such information must be
made available to independent reviewers and the public.

• As Carney points out in his book, Value(s), cost-benefit analysis
should be conducted to determine the economic gains to
consumers, businesses and government within Newfoundland
and Labrador. Additionally, one might wish to estimate the gains to
Quebec groups for comparison purposes.
• One might also consider equity considerations on indigenous and
on those NL households currently living in poverty. The question
is: Will the development or the existence of the proposed projects
increase the economic well-being or overall well-being of these
groups?

--- Page 15 ---

• The $3.8B transmission line project (whose costs fall entirely to
Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro) must be considered part of the
Gull Island project, as they are not independent. Gull Island power
cannot leave the generating station without the line.
• Given the low load factors, the additional power is targeted to specific
months. These patterns suggest that electricity would be targeted to
markets with high seasonal prices. These projects could be very
profitable to HQ. Monthly output projections and distributions should
be produced for the first ten years.
• Much more detail is needed by occupation and compensation level,
since labour markets for large construction projects are expected to be
very tight over the next fifteen years.
• The Newfoundland and Labrador public would be responsible for a very
substantial amount of debt (over 17 billion dollars). Given recent
concerns about debt levels and their sustainability, the public should
be particularly concerned.

• Finally, but perhaps most importantly, the public should re-
examine the role of NLH as a publicly-owned entity focused on
delivering reliable, low-cost power to meet their needs rather than
incurring substantial debt to meet the needs of others in Québec
at subsidized rates lower than they pay for electricity using a
valuable and ever-increasingly scarce resource, namely, water.

Summary and Some Conclusions
• Hydro-Québec is in a very tough situation. It’s electricity
production from its hydroelectric stations has fallen substantially
over the past three years. HQ’s access to very cheap water
resources permits users in Quebec to enjoy the lowest electricity
prices in North America.
• HQ has gone from a net exporter of electricity to its traditional U.S.
markets to a net importer from them.
• HQ apparently expects its electricity demand in Quebec to double over
the next 25 years.
• Presumably, because of limited ideal water resources in Quebec, it is
turning to wind power.
• Quebec has always been a net importer of electricity. Its historic
primary source of imported electricity has been Churchill Falls.

• Given the above, it is natural that Hydro-Québec would turn to the
Churchill River and its part ownership of CF(L)Co to obtain security of
an additional supply of very cheap electricity. While the extra electricity
is primarily to meet Québec’s needs for electricity, the MOU proposes
that Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (more generally, the people of
Newfoundland and Labrador) finance its share of the projects by
primarily (75% of its share) incurring debt. Since we have no idea of the
pricing structure for any additional electricity produced, it is not clear
to me what the benefit would be to the people of Newfoundland and
Labrador of taking on such a large debt. This is especially true when
they are only too familiar with debts arising from recent hydroelectric
developments.
• The strategy in the MOU of offering increased compensation for existing
power for jointly undertaking new projects is not new; it is a repeat of
previous efforts over the past few decades.
• It is not possible to properly evaluate any or all of the proposed
developments under the MOU. Much more information is needed. I
concur with Wade Locke’s conclusions noted at the beginning.

• The massive debt that NLH must incur, and potentially add to the
current high provincial debt, to bring the proposed projects to
completion, should be of great concern to the residents of NL. In a
sense, incurring debt costs for electricity that is to be exported
represents a subsidy to external buyers. Is it the few Newfoundlanders
and Labradorians subsidizing the many Quebecers?
• The Newfoundland and Labrador public must wonder why they are
continuing to finance projects designed to continue to supply cheap
electricity to Quebec for domestic consumption and re-export to
lucrative markets in the USA.
• The proposed upgrade to the CF project may increase, at least, the
benefit from existing power before 2041.
• The ultimate question is: Is the MOU of December 12th, 2024, the Best
Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)? We need additional
information on the proposals in the MOU and consider new, viable
alternatives!
