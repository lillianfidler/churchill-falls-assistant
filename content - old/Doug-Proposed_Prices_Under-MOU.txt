Proposed Prices for Existing Power Under
the MOU

Initial Statement on Proposed Prices for
Existing CF Power
• I understand Hydro-Québec’s (HQ) need for increased supply, given
expanding demand and climate change, and the reduction in
hydroelectric generation. From Quebec’s cost-minimizing perspective,
setting annual prices over long-term contracts would be ideal. The
proposed prices in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are
higher than the existing ones but appear not to be tied to specific
details, such as replacement rates or prices in external competitive
export markets. Any of HQ’s domestic prices seem to be based on the
cost-minimizing principles of a public utility monopolist, in which
potential rents are dissipated to increase equalization payments to the
government.
• The reference to a forecast baseline price of 5.9¢/kWh is based on a
faulty present-value calculation. Given significant structural changes
on the demand side, forecasting beyond 5 years is risky. Any forecast
beyond 10 years, in my opinion, is unreasonable and inappropriate.

--- Page 3 ---

• The use of present-value analysis for the proposed forecasted
prices, while ignoring potential changes in future costs, is
misleading, in my opinion. One cost ignored is the almost non-
existent water royalties under the current agreement. Given water
scarcity and the need to turn to other energy sources such as wind
power or gas, this oversight seems fatal to any proposed pricing
scheme.
• According to the MOU, there appears to be no rationale for the
proposed 5.822% discount rate for nominal prices.
• Presenting cumulative revenue projections over a 51-year period
in nominal, real, or present-value dollars can be misleading to the
public because it ignores the timing of cash receipts.
• My suggestion is to either ignore the prices or treat them with great
caution. The assurance of an adjustment process which is so
vague and lacking in detail that it can be ignored.

Wise Advice
“Recognizing that our level of analytical sophistication has
increased within the province, we still need to be wary of being
snookered by others with more sophistication but different long-
term goals and interests.”
Wade Locke, An Assessment of the December 12, 2024,
Churchill Falls MOU between Newfoundland and Labrador, and
Quebec, January 2025, p.21

Forecasting Annual Prices for Existing CF Generation Under
the MOU.
• Walter Parsons (Vice President, transmissions Interconnections
and Business Development) produced the following chart of
forecasted annual prices in nominal dollars under the MOU. He
discusses these prices in the video referenced above.
• Note that the prices are in “nominal” terms. These prices assume
an annual inflation rate of 2%. If we convert these prices to
“real/constant dollar” (inflation-adjusted) prices, then the
constant dollar/inflation-adjusted price in 2041 is 5.62¢/kWh and
13.60¢/kWh in 2075
• Also note that the prices are paid to CF(L)Co by HQ, which owns
34.2% of CF. The effective price to HQ in 2041 would be
3.69¢/kWh.

• Parsons notes that the new prices are 30x higher than the existing
prices, but it should also be noted that current prices include the
prices for electricity sold under GWAC (Guaranteed Winter
Availability Contract) estimated to be about 5.9¢/kWh for 2026.
• Parsons emphasizes that the prices are forecasted and that the
inflation rate is assumed to be 2% annually.
• While Parsons does note that these are only forecasted prices.
However, they are treated as expected prices, and many
members of the public will treat them as “certainty” prices.
• Parsons acknowledges that other prices might occur, so why
aren’t alternative scenarios presented?
9

--- Page 10 ---

• ChatGPT for the New England-ISO and New York wholesale markets
provides detailed advice. Forecasting periods are broken into 1-3 years, 3-7
years, 10-20 years, and beyond 20. The result is that 1-3 years can be tricky
because of winter demand. In the next period, structural changes begin to
dominate. Beyond 20 years, use scenario bands and not point forecasts.
• Summary: Don’t do what Parsons has done in terms of long-term price
forecasts! Short-term forecasts should include a range and note the
importance of winter and summer conditions on forecasts.
• A picky point: why does Parsons use “average” in his title? Is he referring to
the present value estimate of the average prices, that is, his 5.9¢/kWh? We
will deal with this in the discussion that follows.
10

The “Baseline” Price of 5.9¢/kWh
• It is not clear to me how these prices were arrived at. Exactly, what process
was used to determine the baseline price of 5.9¢ per kWh?
• I believe that this baseline price was intended to be the present value of the
average prices. Parsons converts nominal prices to constant dollars and
then calculates the average value of these constant dollars. The final step is
to convert this final value to present values using a discount rate of 3.822%.
• As an aside, it does not matter whether the present value was calculated
using constant or current dollars, since changes in the discount rate
yield the same present value.
• My question is: were the prices determined first, or was the baseline price
set and the various annual prices determined from it?
• Why did Parsons calculate this present value average price of 5.9¢/kWh?
11

--- Page 12 ---

• Is the importance provided in the following slide from the GNL?
Note that the same GNL presentation refers to the 5.9¢ as the
“effective” price, implying that the price can be compared to the
other prices on the slide.
• If so, should the starting price for 2025 be above 5.9¢, since the
other prices relate to 2024?

Wade Locke’s Analysis of MOU Forecasted
Prices from the MOU for Existing CF Power
• I referenced Wade’s estimates in his Assessment paper on forecasted prices
from the MOU, as they verify Parsons’ forecasted nominal prices.
• We discovered that Wade, in his assessment of the MOU, produces
estimates very similar to those shown in his Figure 10. Readers who are
interested in learning the details and process to arrive at these estimates can
ask AI to fetch the details from Locke’s paper.

The Use of Present Values and Net Present
Values in Financial Analysis
• References to Present Values and Net Present Values are used
frequently in the documents, which explain the benefits of the
MOU arising from changes to the MOU’s forecasted prices for
existing power from Churchill Falls.
• These terms are unknown to most people but are commonly used
in investment projects with revenues and costs spread over a
number of years. The MOU deals with several such projects.
• The problem is basically the following. People are not indifferent
as to when they spend or receive money. This is true even when
prices are in constant dollars. A separate video provides details.
15

--- Page 16 ---

• The basic idea is to convert revenues and costs that are received
and spent over a number of years due to timing differences to a
common point in time. We convert everything back in each year to
the time we are making the decision, the present.
• The value of the revenues over the life of a project is to convert the
revenues in each year to present value and then add up all these
revenue streams.
• We can do the same thing for costs that occur over the years.
• We can subtract the total costs from the total revenues to see
whether we would make a profit. The result is called the Net
Present Value (NPV).

Wade Locke’s present Value Analysis of Forecasted
Prices for Existing CF Electricity
• Wade’s motivation for doing present value analysis was presumably to
verify the analysis done by NLH from the MOU.
• Wade’s analysis is shown below. Note that his estimate of the
forecasted prices in current dollars is very close to Parsons’ forecast.
• Wade produces the present value data for the green line by converting
each price in the blue line back to the present using a 5.822% discount
rate.
• If you multiplied the present value in the blue, say 2.04¢/kWh times the
amount of power generated in that year, then you would have the
present value of the revenue for that year.
• The final step would be to repeat the process for each year, then add up
the present values of these revenues to determine the total revenue
CF(L)Co will receive over the 51 years.

We Have a Problem with Parsons’
Effective Average Present Value Price
• In the chart below, Wade estimates the average present value
price over the period from 2025 to 2075 to be 2.64¢/kWh. Parsons
calculates the average price to be 5.9¢/kWh.
• Wade employs the correct methodology for calculating the PV for
each of the 51 years. Parsons calculates the present value of the
average price, effectively assuming that only 2050 is relevant.
Parsons makes a serious error.
• Most people will find this discussion torturous. Why did we do it?
The answer is that the NLH’s analysis of the MOU, endorsed by the
GNL, stresses the importance of 5.9¢.
• The question I have is: what do NLH and HQ believe the
importance of the 5.9¢ is?

MOU’s Expected Prices and GNL Revenue
• Wade Locke notes in footnote 4 of his paper that while “CF(L)Co
will receive $19.8 B or $1.17 B on average to 2041, that is not
money to treasury. It is money to CF(L)Co of which NLH owns
65.8%. As such, the amount that could flow to the provincial
treasury is $13.1 B or an annual average of $768 M to 2041.” The
amounts are not important, but the reference to CF(L)Co receipts
seems to take our attention away that to some degree HQ is
paying itself.
21

--- Page 22 ---

Misleading Price Comparisons?
• NLH’s statement that the proposed price under the MOU is XX times
the existing price is misleading. The existing winter prices are covered
by the Guaranteed Winter Availability Contract (GWAC), as Locke
points out. Under the Contract conditions as reported by Locke, the
price in 2026 should be $56.77/MWh or 5.7¢/kWh.
• Data from NLH for CF(L)Co could tell us the prices actually paid under
the GWAC, but such data are available only quarterly.
• Q1 2025, GWAC $22.27M to HQ; Q1 2025, HQ energy sales $16.4M.
• Note that price formulas under the GWAC disappear under the MOU.

Price Adjustments for Existing Power Under the MOU
• Wade Locke wrote in his Assessments:
• While Schedule F of the MOU does indicate that the forecast
payments will be “reflective of wholesale electricity market value
in Québec; replacement costs in Québec; and wholesale
electricity market value in northeast export markets”, there is no
indication of the weights attached to either in the pricing
mechanism. My response: This is an important fact.
• Moreover:
• The wholesale electricity market in Quebec is not competitive, but is set
by HQ, which acts as a cost-minimizing monopolist when selling power in
Quebec. Moreover, it acted as a monopsonist when transferring power
from CF(L)Co, in which it is a substantial shareholder (34.2%).
23

--- Page 24 ---

• The replacement costs in Quebec would be a facility that could meet
similar loads and power during peak winter months. Even if we had such
information, the optimal strategy for CF(L)Co might be to sell its power in
the more competitive northeast export markets, which reflect daily and
seasonal price changes. Disclosure: Last spring, I asked NLH about
replacement costs, but I have not received a reply.
• Electricity markets are undergoing major structural changes due
to both demand and supply forces. Specific, not vague,
adjustment procedures are needed to deal with these realities.

An Assessment of the Proposed Pricing Structure
for Existing Power
• Wade Locke wrote: “The MOU document lacks sufficient detail
needed to demonstrate that the deal or the contract that is
expected to ensue from this MOU is better than the 1969
contract.” Page 1 My assessment: Correct
• Moreover:
• The baseline price of 5.9¢/kWh is calculated using an inappropriate
concept and faulty procedures based on expected future prices that are
too distant to be reasonable.
• The suggested price adjustment process is vague in the extreme,
depending on the distribution of electricity to individuals, businesses, and
public organizations in Quebec, and on cost-minimizing strategies. Is
there a “market” as generally understood by the concept? What are the
replacement costs?
25

--- Page 26 ---

• Reporting revenue flows to CF(L)Co may be correct in one sense,
but it is misleading because it does not point out that HQ is a
substantial shareholder and the principal buyer.
• Reporting that the proposed power price under the MOU is X times
the existing rate is misleading, as it ignores the revenue generated
and the prices charged under the Guaranteed Winter Availability
Contract (GWAC). Also note that the GWAC ends under the
proposed MOU.
• The length of the proposed contract, to my knowledge, is much
longer than any other external (outside Quebec) contract that HQ
has signed.
• I believe that the use of set prices as outlined in the MOU is also
inconsistent with other contracts HQ has with parties outside
Quebec. Seasonal pricing promotes the efficient use of electricity.
26

--- Page 27 ---

• How was a real discount rate of 3.822% chosen?
• Coming back to Wade Locke’s first point, that there is a lot of missing
information in the MOU to basically evaluate the desirability, seems to
often apply. The information which is provided is at times not
reasonable or misleading.
• Pricing is an issue!
• One last point. It is well known that Quebec’s electricity prices are the
lowest in Canada and the United States. The reason is that electricity is
generated by hydraulic turbines. The productivity of these turbines
depends on the volume of water in the river and the drop in water level
as it hits the turbines. Regarding Churchill Falls, the Churchill River is
unique. The cost of the water as an energy source is virtually nothing. It
is probably this factor, coupled with HQ’s strategy of minimizing costs
to provide low-cost electricity and perhaps increasing the size of
equalization payments, that accounts for the very low water rents.
