QUEBEC'S ELECTRICITY SUPPLY PICTURE

Total available electricity in Quebec equals domestic production plus imports. Monthly data shows domestic production following expected seasonal patterns with a slight downward slope due to drought. The gap between total electricity available and domestic production represents imports. Import sources include other provinces as the main source with seasonal variation and summer bumps, and the United States with imports from this source increasing in recent years.

IMPORTS FROM ONTARIO

Significant amounts were purchased from Ontario in 2024. One example period showed 97,464 megawatts purchased in a very short time, possibly around Christmas during peak demand. Dynamic pricing applies to these transactions rather than set prices. Prices depend on market conditions of supply and demand and vary month to month, day to day, and even within a single day across various markets. The actual price paid was $32.63 per megawatt-hour, equivalent to 3.23 cents per kWh.

WHY HYDRO-QUEBEC IMPORTS

Hydro-Quebec may import and export during the same month or even partially during the same day. The strategic goal is to optimize use of reservoirs as storage batteries and optimize power use to help minimize costs. The reservoir management strategy involves saving water when imports are available cheaply and releasing water to generate power when it can be sold at high prices, creating arbitrage across time and price variations.

IMPORTS FROM NEW BRUNSWICK

Hydro-Quebec trades electricity with New Brunswick through both exports and imports via the Eel River high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converter station. Pricing is consistent with dynamic pricing, commonly in the range of 8-10 cents per kWh or $80-100 per megawatt-hour. Imports from New Brunswick and possibly Ontario have increased due to decreasing hydro generation in Quebec from drought over the past couple of years.

IMPORTS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR (CHURCHILL FALLS)

Assuming 90% of Churchill Falls electricity goes to Quebec, Churchill Falls contributed approximately 86-88% of provincial imports into Quebec in 2023 and 2024. This is where the main action is in terms of imports for Hydro-Quebec.

The approximate price to Quebec from CF(L)Co is 0.475 cents per kWh, about half a cent, including the guaranteed winter availability premium. However, since Hydro-Quebec owns 34.2% of CF(L)Co, the effective price after ownership adjustment drops to 0.308 cents per kWh. The cost of power production is 0.294 cents per kWh in 2024, sourced from Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro's CF(L)Co financial statements.

The price comparison is stark: Churchill Falls effective price is 0.308 cents per kWh, Ontario imports cost 3.23 cents per kWh, and New Brunswick imports cost 8-10 cents per kWh. Churchill Falls is 10-33 times cheaper than other provincial imports.

IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES

Imports come primarily from New York State. Hydro-Quebec does not appear to import from other states despite having transmission lines to Maine, New York, and into the New England ISO.

From 2015-2021, there was very little import activity from the U.S., with some action in January during power shortages identifiable by small bumps in the data, and a notable larger bump in January 2022. In recent years from 2023-2025, imports from the U.S. have increased dramatically and are now a significant feature, driven by climate change and drought reducing Quebec's own generation.

U.S. import pricing operates as a free market exchange that changes month to month and presumably daily. Dr. May notes data quality concerns with the Canada Energy Regulator, stating the data sometimes does not seem consistent and that he has emailed them several times without receiving a response.

In January 2022, a high import volume period, the price was $200 per megawatt-hour or 20 cents per kWh, driven by extreme demand. Price patterns show big increases in January and winter generally, with an increasing trend over time due to climate change, technological change, growing populations, and other factors. The most recent data from July 2025 shows an import price from New York of $70.40 per megawatt-hour or 7.4 cents per kWh, which is still significantly more expensive than Churchill Falls imports.

SUPPLY-DEMAND GAP ANALYSIS

The gap between total electricity available and domestic demand has been closing rapidly. Before 2023, there was a fair gap providing excess available for export. In 2023 the gap closed significantly, and by 2024 the problem worsened. In the April-July 2025 period, demand essentially meets supply with basically nothing available for export.

Quebec's objective is to be a net exporter. Achieving this requires finding extra power, preferably green energy as part of their long-term plan to 2035. Quebec has invested heavily in new transmission lines into New England through Maine and into New York, wanting to export to New York because of high free-market prices.

WHERE CHURCHILL RIVER PROJECTS FIT IN

The proposed Churchill River projects serve primarily as a cheap source of imported power to Quebec and for meeting peak load demands. The arbitrage opportunity involves saving water in Quebec's reservoirs when importing cheaply from Churchill Falls and exporting Quebec's reservoir water when prices are highest, particularly in January and February with secondary peaks in July and August.

Businesses prefer set annual prices for certainty, but the free market reality is highly uncertain with prices varying month to month, day to day, and with a big unknown about the next 5 years. U.S. projections suggest demand for renewable electricity could increase by approximately 25% over the next 5 years, which would drive prices even higher.

IMPORT PRICE HIERARCHY

From cheapest to most expensive: Churchill Falls at 0.308 cents per kWh effective or 0.475 cents nominal; Ontario at 3.23 cents per kWh which is 10 times more than Churchill Falls; U.S. in July 2025 at 7.4 cents per kWh which is 24 times more; New Brunswick at 8-10 cents per kWh which is 26-32 times more; and U.S. peak periods at up to 20 cents per kWh which is 65 times more than Churchill Falls.

KEY STATISTICS

Import prices per kWh: Churchill Falls effective 0.308 cents, Churchill Falls nominal 0.475 cents, Churchill Falls production cost 0.294 cents, Ontario 3.23 cents, New Brunswick 8-10 cents, U.S. July 2025 at 7.4 cents, U.S. peak or January up to 20 cents. Churchill Falls share of provincial imports: 86-88%. U.S. imports have dramatically increased in 2023-2025. U.S. renewable electricity demand projected to increase 25% over 5 years. Quebec supply-demand gap closed by 2025 with export capacity virtually eliminated. Hydro-Quebec ownership of CF(L)Co: 34.2%, which reduces the effective Churchill Falls price by 34.2%.
