WHERE DOES CHURCHILL FALLS FIT IN THE QUEBEC PICTURE?

Churchill Falls has a rated capacity of 5,428 megawatts per hour while Robert-Bourassa has 5,616 megawatts per hour, giving Robert-Bourassa the higher rated capacity. However, in actual generation especially with the current drought, Churchill Falls likely generates more electricity over a year. In 2024, Robert-Bourassa generated approximately 30 terawatts (30,000 megawatts) while Churchill Falls generated approximately 34,500 megawatts. Assuming 90% of Churchill Falls output goes to Quebec, that amounts to approximately 31 terawatts (31,000 megawatts), making Churchill Falls still the most productive single source of electricity for Hydro-Quebec. Churchill Falls is extremely important to Hydro-Quebec, providing both the most power from a single station and at the lowest cost.

COST ANALYSIS OF CHURCHILL FALLS

Churchill Falls was built approximately 10 years before Robert-Bourassa, meaning expected construction costs would be cheaper due to lower inflation in the earlier period, and more capital costs have been written off over time. Dr. May's analysis using NL Hydro data shows a cost of $2.95 per megawatt-hour, equivalent to 0.295 cents per kWh.

The revenue puzzle is that the cost seems low because selling at 0.2 cents per kWh would create a loss, yet CF(L)Co made a profit in 2024. The explanation lies in multiple revenue streams: the base contract price of 0.2 cents per kWh often cited publicly, a guaranteed winter availability premium that adds to revenue, and special arrangements where NL Hydro sometimes gives up some of its power allocation and Hydro-Quebec pays premium prices for this additional power. The actual average revenue per kWh is approximately 5.9 cents per kWh, which explains profitability since revenue exceeds costs.

Some sources suggest Robert-Bourassa costs 5-7 cents per kWh, though Dr. May observes this seems extremely high and notes the cost differential of 0.3 cents versus 5-7 cents seems like too much of a difference. He invites Hydro-Quebec to provide the actual information.

HYDRO-QUEBEC'S OWNERSHIP AND PERCEPTION

Hydro-Quebec owns 34.2% of CF(L)Co while NL Hydro (Nalcor) owns 65.8%. Hydro-Quebec likely considers CF(L)Co a part of its Quebec operations and views Churchill Falls as integral to its hydro generating capacity.

Historical context is important: during the 1927 Labrador Boundary dispute, Quebec believed the Churchill River basin was officially part of Quebec. The British Privy Council ruled differently, awarding it to Newfoundland. This historical claim still figures in Quebec's perception, and Quebec sees Churchill Falls as an integral part of its own system. The result is that Hydro-Quebec forces CF(L)Co to be a cost minimizer, producing extremely low-cost electricity that helps explain why household prices in Montreal are the lowest in Canada and the G7.

CHURCHILL FALLS' ROLE IN QUEBEC'S INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY

Seven of eight aluminum smelters in Canada are located in Quebec because cheap electricity is critical for aluminum smelting, and Churchill Falls helps explain their location. This is part of Quebec's deliberate industrial strategy.

The growing drought in the James Bay area reducing Quebec's own generation increases the relative importance of Churchill Falls. Churchill Falls projects proposed under the MOU are becoming even more important, and this importance will continue to grow.

WHY MONTREAL ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE SO LOW

Three key factors relate to Churchill Falls. First, it is the most productive generating station in the Hydro-Quebec system as Quebec sees it, providing the most power from a single station at approximately 17% of total electricity available to Quebec, and doing so at the lowest cost available by far.

Second, even if the price Hydro-Quebec pays CF(L)Co increases, the effective price only increases by 65.8% of the nominal increase because Hydro-Quebec is paying itself for its 34.2% share. Dr. May criticizes other analyses from Newfoundland and Labrador for not accounting for this ownership factor when presenting prices.

Third, the relative importance of Churchill Falls electricity to Quebec is growing and will continue to grow as drought increases reducing Quebec's own generation and demand for electricity in Quebec increases. Free market electricity prices throughout North America are also increasing due to technological change, AI data centres, greater everyday use of electricity including electric cars, and population expansion, making Churchill Falls' fixed-price power even more valuable to Quebec.

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL GENERATING CAPACITY UNDER THE MOU

Three major projects are proposed. Gull Island is the most significant, a completely new generating station with installed capacity of 2,250 megawatts per hour. The Churchill Falls New Powerhouse expansion would add two new turbines with additional capacity of 1,100 megawatts per hour. The Churchill Falls Upgrade modernization would upgrade existing turbines for an additional 550 megawatts per hour. Total new or upgraded capacity would be 3,900 megawatts per hour. Associated infrastructure includes new transmission lines from Gull Island to the grid, to be paid for by Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro.

CRITICAL INFORMATION GAPS

Several pieces of information needed for proper analysis are unavailable. Actual expected generation figures are unknown; only capacity figures have been shared, and capacity does not equal generation as demonstrated by the Churchill Falls versus Robert-Bourassa comparison. The projects will be operated on-demand, possibly primarily for peak loading periods in summer and winter, making exact generation patterns difficult to predict.

Associated prices for electricity from each project are unknown and may be the same across all three or different. The dynamic versus fixed pricing question is unresolved; current discussions focus on fixed annual prices, but Hydro-Quebec is promoting dynamic pricing for households, businesses, and free market transactions, and dynamic prices have increased very substantially over the last year during peak periods.

Annual cost estimates lack timing information about when costs will occur, which is critical because capital budgeting and cost-benefit analysis require timing information. Dr. May concludes that the analysis needed in business or the public sector to make a sound decision is simply not available.

Premier Legault has publicly stated these projects will provide long-term cheap power to Hydro-Quebec benefiting domestic customers, and without them electricity prices in Quebec would have to increase much more. However, Hydro-Quebec and NL Hydro are advocating a very aggressive construction timeline, and by the time projects are commissioned and operational, the world will be quite different. Any deficiencies in the current agreement that people perceive will be magnified 5-10 years from now.
