Québec’s Electricity Supply Problem:
(Follows Video #3-A on Imports in the CRPP Series)

The Role Of Churchill Falls Import in
Quebec’s Electricity Picture (Video 3-A)
• CF electricity is a necessary “import” to Hydro-Quebec (HQ). It
guarantees Quebec a long-term, secure, and extremely cheap source
of electricity to meet its domestic needs and to profitably export
electricity to NB, particularly to the USA.
• As such, CF electricity enables HQ to provide Quebec households and
businesses with the cheapest power in Canada and the G7, which
includes the USA.
• Some would say that NL “subsidizes” the low prices.
• The key to CF electricity’s low price is the almost free cost of the vast
water resources of the Churchill River.
• As the former Government of Newfoundland and Labrador wrote in its
“Our Chapter”, it hopes the MOU will unlock the “value” of CF.

HQ’s Import Picture 2022 & Earlier
• In 2022, 14.0% of the electricity available in Quebec came from
imports.
• 13.7% of the available power came from other provinces, some from
Ontario, but the vast majority from Churchill Falls.
• 0.3% came from the USA
• Before 2022, HQ rarely imported power from the USA.

According to CER, all imports by HQ from the USA are from NY state. HQ says differently.

The Amazing Restructuring of
HQ’s Import Picture in 2024 & 2025
• In the first eight months of 2025, total imports were down 4.2% from
the same period last year.
• Imports from other provinces were down 13.6% during this period.
• Imports from the USA were up 111.4%!
• In the first eight months of 2025, imports from the USA exceeded
exports. Traditionally, during this same time period, exports to the USA
are greater are greater than imports. This is an amazing change in
electricity trading patterns with the USA.
• In 2024, 17.4% of the electricity available to Quebec came from
imports.
• 15.7% of the available power came from other provinces.
• An approximate estimation is that about 31.5 TWh of electricity imported into
Quebec in 2024 came from Churchill Falls. This represented about 80.6% of the
total imported power.
• 1.7% came from the USA

CAUTION:
• Statistics Canada table (25-10-0016-01) on imports, exports, and
domestic use concerns total electricity for Quebec, not solely
Hydro-Québec. Hydro-Quebec’s production is about 90% of the
total generation in Quebec. I believe that most imports and
exports are through HQ. Non-HQ production is likely to be
primarily for domestic industrial production.
• Statistics Canada considers CF’s electricity to be an “import” into
Quebec and an “export” from NL. Since HQ is a substantial
shareholder of CF(L)Co, which owns the CF generating station, I
believe that HQ does not include CF power as an “import” in its
publications.

Conclusions
• There is a growing dependency in Quebec on imported power,
particularly relatively expensive electricity (about 25 times more
expensive than CF electricity) from the USA.

• Churchill Falls, with its super cheap power, has reached its generating
capacity and cannot export more power to Quebec.
• HQ has a long-term security problem with a cheap electricity supply!
