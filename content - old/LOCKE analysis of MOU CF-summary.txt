Summary created: January 17, 2026
Purpose: Concise version for fast voice responses - Wade Locke's perspective

WADE LOCKE'S MAIN ASSESSMENT:

Cautiously optimistic with significant concerns. The MOU represents substantial revenue increases BUT lacks sufficient detail to demonstrate it's better than the 1969 contract. "We still need to be wary of being snookered by others with more sophistication but different long-term goals and interests."

CENTRAL QUESTION:

Is this a good deal, or "the start of another bad deal in which Newfoundland and Labrador has been snookered again, but this time in a more sophisticated way than in 1969?"

POSITIVES:
• Revenues substantial and potentially transformative
• Some protection from cost overruns and delays
• 183% increase in power available for Labrador
• Substantial immediate revenue increase

CONCERNS:
• Insufficient information to thoroughly evaluate projects
• Province NOT protected from all risks
• Requires borrowing close to current net debt level ($17-18B)
• Many legitimate questions unanswered
• Lack of detail on key financial mechanisms

1969 CONTRACT CONTEXT:

Original Terms:
• 1969-2016: 0.25¢/kWh
• 2016-2041: 0.2¢/kWh (LOWER than original)

Historic Inequity (as of 2019):
• Quebec profits: ~$28 billion
• NL profits: ~$2 billion

Feehan & Baker (2010): "Unlikely CF(L)Co will cover operating costs"

GOVERNMENT CLAIMS vs LOCKE'S CORRECTIONS:

CLAIM: "$1 billion/year to treasury"
LOCKE'S CORRECTION:
• CF(L)Co receives $1.17B average (not treasury)
• NL treasury gets 65.8% share = $768M annually
• Not $1B to treasury as claimed

CLAIM: "Four times as much energy for Labrador"
LOCKE'S CORRECTION:
• 3,900 MW is COMBINED increase from all projects
• NL access increases from 525 MW to 1,990 MW
• Actual increase: 378% (not 400%)

CLAIM: "Fully protected from cost overruns"
LOCKE'S CORRECTION - NL IS exposed to:
• 100% of transmission line cost overruns
• 65.8% of Churchill Falls upgrade overruns
• Only Gull Island and CF expansion have HQ accepting overruns

PRICING MECHANISM:

MOU Price Increase:
• 0.2¢/kWh → 5.9¢/kWh (30× higher)
• Will escalate over time
• Tied to market prices

CRITICAL GAP:
• Prices "reflective of" Quebec wholesale market, replacement costs, and northeast export markets
• NO indication of weights attached to each factor
• Cannot properly assess future revenue

THE $33.8 BILLION FIGURE:

What It Is:
• Present value of nominal revenue (discounted at 5.822%)
• Amount needed to invest today to generate equivalent cash flow
• NOT "today's dollars" as commonly understood

Total Payments:
• $195B nominal dollars to CF(L)Co over term
• $33.8B present value

PROJECT BREAKDOWN:

Gull Island (2,250 MW):
• Ownership: 60% NLH, 40% HQ
• Capital cost: $24.9B (including financing)
• Target: 2035
• Return on equity: 8-9% (Canada 10-year + 500 bps)
• HQ accepts cost overruns
• 50-year PPA, no automatic renewal
• NL access: 225 MW

Churchill Falls Expansion (1,100 MW):
• Ownership: 65.8% NLH, 34.2% HQ (CF(L)Co)
• Capital cost: $4.6B (including financing)
• Target: 2035
• Return: 8-9%
• HQ accepts cost overruns
• 50-year PPA
• NL access: 135 MW

Churchill Falls Upgrade (550 MW):
• Ownership: 65.8% NLH, 34.2% HQ
• Capital cost: $1.9B (including financing)
• 2028-2038 rollout
• Cost-plus pricing
• NL exposed to 65.8% of overruns
• NL access: 135 MW

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS:

NL Debt Requirements:
• Total project costs: $35.0B
• NL equity obligations: $5.7B
• HQ payment for equity: $4.8B
• NL still needs to borrow: $17-18B
• Context: Approximately EQUAL to current provincial net debt

HQ Payment:
• $4.8B nominal ($3.5B present value)
• For 40% of Gull Island and development rights
• Locke's question: Is 40% of Gull Island NPV > $3.5B?

REVENUE COMPARISON:

Current (2023):
• CF(L)Co total: $103M
• From HQ + GWAC: $65M
• NL treasury (65.8%): ~$43M

MOU Average (to 2041):
• CF(L)Co total: $1.17B (11× increase)
• From new PPA: $1.17B (18× increase)
• NL treasury: $768M (18× increase)

EMPLOYMENT:

Construction Jobs:
• Average: 3,000 direct, 5,000 total
• Peak: 5,000 direct, 9,500 total
• Period: 5-11 years depending on project

Hiring Protocol (in order):
1. Innu Nation (qualified)
2. Labrador residents
3. Provincial residents
4. Rest of Canada

CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED BY LOCKE:

Cannot calculate NPV because MOU omits:
1. Time profile of capital costs
2. Time profile of O&M costs
3. Production profile for electricity
4. Time profile of expected prices
5. Detailed power flow breakdown
6. Pricing mechanism weights
7. Conditions for HQ payments

Locke's Conclusion:
"Not sufficient information in the MOU to thoroughly evaluate all, or any, of the proposed new developments"

LOCKE'S PERSPECTIVE ON ANALYSIS:

• This is independent critique from respected MUN economist
• NOT saying deal is bad - saying insufficient info to fully assess
• Analysis done with publicly available information only
• More detailed assessment requires confidential negotiating data
• "Cautiously optimistic" but many questions remain

CLOSING WARNING:

"We should learn from our history, not be constrained by it. We ought not to be afraid to make a good deal that is in our interest, but we need to be wary given that we do not know the future with precision."

KEY STATISTICS:
• Price increase: 0.2¢ → 5.9¢/kWh (30×)
• Revenue increase: $65M → $1.17B (18×)
• NL treasury: $43M → $768M annually (18×)
• New capacity: 3,900 MW total
• NL access increase: 525 MW → 1,990 MW (378%)
• NL borrowing needed: $17-18B
• Current NL net debt: ~$17-18B
• HQ equity payment: $4.8B nominal
• Total project costs: $35.0B
• Construction jobs peak: 9,500 total
• 1969-2019 inequity: Quebec $28B, NL $2B
