Purpose: Concise version for fast voice responses - Doug May's perspective

DOUG'S MAIN ARGUMENT (VIDEO 2A):

Quebec's electricity is so cheap because it's primarily hydroelectric, especially from large generating stations like Robert-Bourassa on La Grande Rivière that benefit from economies of scale. Churchill Falls is even cheaper - about 17-24 times less expensive than La Grande generation.

KEY POINTS FROM DOUG'S ANALYSIS:

QUEBEC'S PRICING STRUCTURE (APRIL 2025):
• Montreal households: 8.30 cents/kWh average (for 1,550 kWh monthly usage)
• St. John's: 15.022 cents/kWh (80% more expensive than Montreal)
• Montreal = cheapest electricity in Canada and among G7 countries
• Future increases: Up to 3% annually for next 5 years, then mandatory review

TIERED PRICING:
• First 1,200 kWh/month: 6.678 cents/kWh
• Above 1,200 kWh/month: 10.153 cents/kWh
• Plus monthly basic charge

DYNAMIC PRICING CONCEPT:
• Hydro-Québec promoting time-of-day and seasonal pricing
• Higher prices during peak hours (breakfast, dinner times)
• Higher in winter (high demand), lower in spring/summer
• Encourages consumers to shift usage to off-peak periods

WHY QUEBEC PRICES ARE SO LOW:

1. HYDROELECTRIC DOMINANCE:
• Over 90% of power from hydroelectric (declining due to drought)
• Large hydro stations benefit from economies of scale
• "Cheap green energy" - no fossil fuel costs

2. CROWN CORPORATION STRATEGY:
• Hydro-Québec = government-owned, regulated monopolist
• Primary objective: Cost minimizer (NOT profit maximizer)
• Essential service mandate - public interest over profit

3. EQUALIZATION PAYMENT STRATEGY:
• Quebec economist strategy (late 1990s): "Dissipate the rents"
• Keep prices low to minimize provincial revenue
• Lower revenue = higher federal equalization payments
• Economic term: "Rent dissipation" strategy

ROBERT-BOURASSA GENERATING STATION:
• Location: La Grande Rivière (James Bay area)
• Slightly higher rated capacity than Churchill Falls
• Capacity utilization: ~78% (vs Churchill Falls 72%)
• Annual output: 29,600 units - actually less than Churchill Falls
• Reservoir acts as "storage battery" - water release timed strategically

COST STRUCTURE:

La Grande Complex:
• Average accounting cost: $50-70 per megawatt-hour
• Equivalent: 5-7 cents per kilowatt-hour
• Doug's note: "Seems relatively high to me"

Churchill Falls:
• Average cost: $2.95 per megawatt-hour
• Equivalent: 0.295 cents per kilowatt-hour
• 31,050,000 MWh annually to Quebec (90% of total)
• **17-24 TIMES CHEAPER than La Grande generation**

THE OWNERSHIP FACTOR:
• CF(L)Co operates Churchill Falls
• Hydro-Québec owns 34.2% of CF(L)Co
• To extent of 34.2%, HQ is "paying itself"
• Some characterize: HQ has "captured" or is "holding hostage" CF(L)Co

DROUGHT IMPACT ON COSTS:
• Fixed costs remain constant (capital, labor, infrastructure)
• Variable input (water) decreases
• Result: Average cost per kWh INCREASES
• Same fixed costs ÷ lower output = higher average cost
• Happening at Robert-Bourassa and other La Grande dams

WATER AS ECONOMIC INPUT:

Production Function: Q = f(K, L, E, M, S, W)
• W = WATER (the critical input for hydro)
• Before ~2015: Water may have been "free good" in Quebec
• Now recognized as scarce resource with environmental cost

Quebec Water Royalty System:
• Rate: 0.75% of total revenue from hydro-electricity sales
• Applied to electricity generated and sold in Quebec
• Recognizes water as resource with value

COST RANKING (LOW TO HIGH):
1. Large hydro stations (La Grande complex) - relatively inexpensive
2. Other hydro facilities - moderate
3. Wind farms - more expensive than hydro

TRANSMISSION CONTEXT:
• Generation costs: At dam/station
• Transmission costs: High-voltage lines
• Distribution costs: Local delivery to homes
• Historical: Quebec wouldn't allow transmission through province
• Ottawa discouraged Smallwood from forcing issue under British North America Act

DOUG'S KEY MESSAGE:

"It's hydroelectricity that provides the fundamental cost advantage"

Specifically:
• Most productive stations on La Grande Rivière
• Robert-Bourassa is "the really big one"
• Large generating stations = economies of scale
• More water flow capacity = lower per-unit costs

TRANSITION TO VIDEO 2B:

• What role does Churchill Falls play in cost structure?
• Why does Hydro-Québec need CF upgrade, enlargement, and Gull Island?

CRITICAL STATISTICS:
• Montreal: 8.30¢/kWh average
• St. John's: 15.022¢/kWh (80% higher)
• Quebec generation: >90% hydro
• CF capacity utilization: 72%
• Robert-Bourassa utilization: 78%
• La Grande cost: 5-7¢/kWh
• Churchill Falls cost: 0.295¢/kWh
• CF to Quebec: 31,050,000 MWh/year
• HQ ownership of CF(L)Co: 34.2%
• Water royalty: 0.75% of revenue
