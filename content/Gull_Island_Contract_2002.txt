DOCUMENT TYPE: Framework Agreement for the Development of Gull Island
DATE: November 14, 2002
STATUS: Historical document - negotiations did not proceed to completion

PARTIES:
1. Gull Island Energy Corporation (wholly-owned subsidiary of NLH)
2. Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (NLH)
3. Hydro-Québec (HQ)
4. Her Majesty in Right of Newfoundland and Labrador

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Purpose of Agreement

Framework for developing Gull Island hydroelectric project with:
- **Ownership, development, engineering, construction** by Gull Island Energy Corp.
- **Construction financing and long-term financing** by Hydro-Québec
- **Operation and maintenance** by Gull Island Energy Corp.
- **Sale and delivery of energy** to Hydro-Québec at delivery point
- **Conditions precedent** for Project Release
- **Framework for Additional Agreements** required

### Key Terms at a Glance

**Project ownership:** 100% Gull Island Energy Corp. (NL Crown corporation, wholly-owned by NLH)
**Power purchaser:** Hydro-Québec (all power less NL recall)
**Price:** $35.50/MWh (indexed to HQ's North American sales price)
**Minimum price:** $33.50/MWh for first 10 years
**Term:** 45 years from Project Completion Date
**Financing:** 100% by Hydro-Québec (non-recourse to NL or NLH)
**NL recall rights:** Up to 500 MW cumulative (phased over 20 years)
**Project Release deadline:** April 1, 2006

### Historical Context

**This agreement was never executed.** The 2002 framework established terms for Gull Island development between NL and Quebec, but negotiations did not proceed to Project Release. The project remained undeveloped until the 2010s when NL pursued Lower Churchill development independently through Muskrat Falls and (planned) Gull Island.

**Comparison to 2024 MOU:**
The 2024 MOU represents a completely different approach to Gull Island development, with different ownership structure (60% NLH / 40% HQ), different pricing mechanisms, and different financing arrangements.

### 2.2 Energy Sales

**Power Purchase Agreement:**
- Gull Island will sell and deliver to HQ: ALL power produced
- LESS any power recalled by Gull Island (see 2.9 Recall)
- From Project In-Service Date through Term
- Delivery at the Delivery Point

### 2.3 Price

**Base price:** $35.50 per megawatt hour (MWh)
- Adjusted with base year = year in which Project Release occurs

**Minimum price protection:** $33.50/MWh
- Applies for first full 10 years of Term after Project In-Service Date
- Floor price to protect NL from downside risk

### 2.4 Annual Price Index (Escalation Mechanism)

**Formula:**
```
Annual Price Index = 1 + [(HQ Avg. Price Year X - HQ Avg. Price Year X-1) / HQ Avg. Price Year X-1]
```

**Where HQ's Average Gross Sales Price equals:**
```
HQ's total annual revenue from power sales in North America ($) 
÷ 
HQ's total quantity of power sold in North America (MWh)
```

**Key features:**
- Price indexed to **HQ's actual North American sales price**
- Based on audited HQ results
- Commences at Project Release Date
- Applied annually, adjusted to reflect actual results at year end
- First base year = year of Project Release

**Significance:** Price moves with HQ's market performance, not fixed or predetermined escalation

### 2.5 Term

**Power Purchase Agreement duration:** 45 years
- Starts from Project Completion Date
- No automatic renewal mentioned

## COMPARISON: 2002 FRAMEWORK vs 2024 MOU

### Ownership Structure

**2002 Framework:**
- 100% Gull Island Energy Corp. (NL Crown corp, wholly-owned by NLH)
- HQ = lender and power purchaser, not equity owner

**2024 MOU:**
- 60% NL Hydro / 40% Hydro-Québec equity ownership
- Joint development partnership

### Pricing

**2002 Framework:**
- $35.50/MWh base price (adjusted from Project Release year)
- Floor of $33.50/MWh for first 10 years
- Indexed to HQ's North American sales price
- 45-year term

**2024 MOU:**
- 5.9¢/kWh ($59/MWh) effective average price
- Indexed to: Quebec wholesale market, replacement costs, northeast export markets
- 50-year term (to 2075)

### Financing

**2002 Framework:**
- 100% financing by HQ
- Non-recourse to NL/NLH
- Interest = HQ cost of debt plus 150bp during construction, HQ cost of debt after

**2024 MOU:**
- HQ pays $3.5B (present value) / $4.8B (nominal) for development rights
- Cost-plus return structure with 8-9% ROE
- HQ manages construction for Gull Island, accepts cost overruns
- NL Hydro has some construction risk exposure (transmission, CF upgrade)

### NL Power Access

**2002 Framework:**
- Up to 500 MW cumulative recall rights (phased over 20 years)
- 5-year notice requirement

---

## WHY 2002 FRAMEWORK DID NOT PROCEED

### Conditions Precedent Not Met

**Key deadlines:**
- Innu consultation: June 30, 2003
- EPC Contract: November 30, 2004
- Project Release: April 1, 2006

**The 2002 Framework terminated** because conditions precedent were not satisfied by deadlines

### Likely Reasons (Context from Historical Research)

**From historical documents:**
1. **Economic viability questions** - Project economics at $35.50/MWh may not have been compelling
2. **Innu consultation challenges** - Land claims negotiations ongoing
3. **Market conditions** - Electricity demand/pricing may not have supported development
4. **Political factors** - Danny Williams government (2003-2010) pursued different strategy
5. **Alternative approaches** - NL eventually decided to develop Lower Churchill independently

### Subsequent History

**2000s:** Project did not advance
**2010:** Muskrat Falls project announced (Lower Churchill first phase)
**2012:** Gull Island Environmental Assessment completed
**2024:** New MOU signed with fundamentally different structure

---

## SIGNIFICANCE FOR CHURCHILL FALLS AI AGENT

### Historical Context

**This 2002 Framework shows:**
- NL and Quebec have negotiated Gull Island development before
- Previous terms were very different from 2024 MOU
- 100% NL ownership was once on the table
- HQ role as lender vs equity partner distinction
- Strong NL-first provisions were negotiated in 2002

### Key Comparisons Users May Ask About

**Ownership:** 100% NL (2002) vs 60/40 NL/HQ (2024)
**Pricing:** $35.50/MWh indexed to HQ sales (2002) vs $59/MWh indexed to multiple factors (2024)
**Risk:** HQ financing non-recourse (2002) vs NL borrowing $17-18B (2024)
**Management:** NL manages from NL (2002) vs HQ manages construction (2024)

### Why This Matters

**Historical precedent for:**
- Different deal structures
- NL negotiating leverage
- Alternative approaches to development
- Comparison points for evaluating 2024 MOU

**Shows that:**
- Current MOU is not the only possible structure
- Trade-offs between control, risk, and financing
- Both provinces have long sought Gull Island development
