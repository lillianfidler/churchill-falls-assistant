DR. DOUG MAY VIDEO ANALYSIS - VIDEO 3B OF 6
Hydro-Québec's Electricity Exports
===================================

AUTHOR: Dr. Doug May, Economist, Memorial University of Newfoundland

SERIES: Video 3B of 6 examining Quebec's electricity landscape

FOCUS: Export volumes and prices from Hydro-Québec, primarily to United States

NOTE: Companion to Video 3A on imports. This video examines the export side of Hydro-Québec's electricity trade.

---

## OVERVIEW: PRODUCTION VS. AVAILABILITY VS. EXPORTS

### The Supply Chart (Familiar from Previous Videos)

**Components:**
- Orange area: Domestic production in Quebec
- Green area: Total electricity available in Quebec
- Difference between production and availability = imports (covered in Video 3A)
- Difference between availability and domestic demand = **net exports**

**Important note:** Hydro-Québec can be both exporting and importing simultaneously with same state or province

---

## TOTAL EXPORT VOLUMES: DECLINING TREND

### Export Destinations
- United States
- Other provinces (primarily New Brunswick)

### Total Export Trends (Gray Line on Chart)

**Pattern:** Total amount of power exported is **going down over time**
**Reason:** Drought (discussed in previous videos)

**Blue line:** Power going to United States
- Historically above power to other provinces

**Recent dramatic shift:**
- U.S. exports declining more rapidly than provincial exports
- **By June 2025:** U.S. exports fallen BELOW exports to other provinces
- Primary provincial destination: New Brunswick (long-term relationships with Hydro-Québec)

---

## THE EXPORT PARADOX

### Quebec's Reputation vs. Reality

**Reputation:** Major power-exporting province

**Reality (current situation):**
- Total exports: **Less than 5% of total power available**
- Exports to United States: **Approximately 1.5%**

**Dr. May's observation:** "Quite surprising"

### The Investment Question

**Recent heavy investments:**
- New transmission lines into New England ISO (through Maine)
- New transmission lines into New York

**Current status:** "Presumably are not really being used"

---

## U.S. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (EIA) ANALYSIS

### Eastern Connections Trade Patterns

**Data source:** United States Energy Information Administration (EIA)

**Focus:** Electricity trade on Eastern connections between:
- Hydro-Québec and New England ISO (new transmission line)
- Hydro-Québec and New York ISO

### Historical Pattern (Pre-2023)

**Imports into United States from Quebec:**
- Lighter shade of red: Imports into New York from Hydro-Québec
- Darker shade of red: Imports into New England from Hydro-Québec
- **New York received GREATER imports than New England**

### The 2023 Reversal

**Major shift:**
- Most imports into U.S. now coming through New York connection
- **New England (darker red) now EXPORTING into Quebec**
- **Critical observation:** "Transmission lines supposed to take power from Quebec into New England, but instead they're taking power from New England into Quebec"

**This represents a complete reversal of intended power flow direction**

## EXPORT/IMPORT PRICING (EIA DATA)

### Market Definition
**"East of Canada" = Ontario, Quebec, Maritimes, and Labrador**

**Exports:** From U.S. east to Canada east
**Imports:** From Canada east to U.S. (primarily Quebec and Ontario, some New Brunswick)

### Price Patterns (Dollars per Megawatt-Hour)

**Characteristic:** Prices move around significantly

**U.S. exports to Canada (green line):**
- Increasing trend
- Peak around October: ~$140 per megawatt-hour (14¢/kWh)

**Canadian exports to U.S. (imports from U.S. perspective):**
- Fair amount of movement/volatility
- **Significant spikes:** Over $150 per megawatt-hour (15¢/kWh)
- Some periods quite high

### Data Gap: Interprovincial Trade Pricing

**What we showed:** Export and import volumes between provinces

**What's missing:** Prices for interprovincial electricity trade

**Who knows these prices:**
- Hydro-Québec
- New Brunswick Energy  
- Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro

**Availability:** "They're not sharing it with us"

**Dr. May's frustration:** "It's strange. You're trying to examine what's going on, but you can't get a hold of the information that you'd really like to."

## EXPORT VOLUMES BY DESTINATION (DETAILED ANALYSIS)

### Data Quality Note
**Volume data:** Fairly accurate (Canada Energy Regulator shares with Statistics Canada)
**Price/value data:** Sometimes inconsistent (noted concern)

### Quebec Exports to New York

**Pattern:**
- Increasing trend through 2022
- **2023: Big dive down**
- Continued low in 2024-2025

### Quebec Exports to New England ISO

**Pattern:**
- Declining trend
- **2023: Virtually non-existent**
- Continued minimal exports

### Newfoundland and Labrador Exports (Gray Lines)

**To New York (solid gray line):**
- Steady initially
- Drop down in middle period
- **Now picking back up**

**To New England (dotted gray line):**
- Previously minimal
- **Significant increase recently**

**Key observation:** "Where Quebec wasn't shipping into New England, but guess which province is? Newfoundland and Labrador."

**Dr. May's assessment:** "Very interesting pattern"

## EXPORT PRICES TO U.S. MARKETS (DETAILED PRICING ANALYSIS)

### Chart Components

**Price unit:** Canadian dollars per megawatt-hour

**Lines:**
- Blue line: Hydro-Québec exports
- Solid gray line: NL Hydro exports to New York
- Dotted gray line: NL Hydro exports to New England ISO

**Data source:** Canada Energy Regulator
**Data quality note:** "Sometimes their data seems a little bit inconsistent. I think the volume data are good, but the price and value data seem to be sometimes at odds with patterns that we see."

### Pricing Patterns: Dynamic Pricing Evidence

**Seasonal pattern clearly visible:**
- High in January
- Slight increase July/August  
- High in January again
- July/August increase
- High in January again

**Pattern consistency:** Prices follow "somewhat similar patterns" across different exporters

### Specific Price Examples

**July 2025 - Hydro-Québec to Maine:**
- Price: **$192.53 per megawatt-hour**
- Equivalent: **19.25 cents per kilowatt-hour**

**July 2025 - NL Hydro to New England:**
- Price: Similar range to Quebec exports
- Also approximately **19.24 cents per kilowatt-hour**

### The Profit Margin Analysis

**Production cost:** ~0.3 cents per kWh
**Quebec price to CF(L)Co:** ~0.48 cents per kWh (half a cent)
**Export price to New England:** ~19 cents per kWh

**Dr. May's observation:** "That's quite a spread there. From point three or half a cent... [to] 19 cents. That's a pair of spread."

**Profit margin:** Approximately 40-63× markup from cost to export price

## DATA INCONSISTENCIES: THE NEW YORK PRICING PUZZLE

### Quebec Exports to New York Pricing

**Pattern description:** "Much more of a crazy pattern, and sometimes a suspect pattern"

### June 2025 Example (Questionable Data Point)

**Reported price:** $265.12 per megawatt-hour
**Equivalent:** 26.5 cents per kilowatt-hour

**Dr. May's skepticism:** "Do I really believe... that they were selling... at... 26 and a half cents per megawatt hour?"

### Reality Check: Boston Residential Comparison

**Dr. May's family in Boston:** Pay approximately 43 cents per kWh (U.S. dollars)
**Converted to Canadian:** Even higher than 26.5¢/kWh
**Assessment:** "That's pretty high"

### Implication of High Prices

**Strategic importance of reservoir management:**
- Save water in reservoir
- Generate/sell when can get highest price
- This is why dynamic pricing and reservoir-as-battery strategy is so valuable

---

## PROFIT MAXIMIZATION IN EXPORT MARKETS

### Market Characteristics

**Export markets (Canadian and especially American):**
- Very free markets
- Prices vary day to day
- Prices vary month to month  
- Prices vary within months at different times

### Hydro-Québec's Strategy

**Operational approach:** **Profit maximizer** in export markets

**Strategy execution:**
- Uses reservoir management strategically
- Generates power when prices highest
- Reports show substantial profit from this strategy
- Discusses strategy openly in annual reports

### NL Hydro's Export Strategy

**When can NL Hydro maximize profit:**
- When not required to sell to Quebec
- When Quebec doesn't want the power
- Can sell into American markets

**Result:** NL Hydro also becomes profit maximizer in these circumstances

---

## THE VOLUME-PRICE-PROFIT RELATIONSHIP

### The Paradox

**Volume trend:** Going down
**Price trend:** Going up
**Profit trend:** Going up

**Explanation:**
- Despite declining export volumes
- Rising prices more than compensate
- Hydro-Québec's reported profits increasing

### Why Prices Are Rising

**Primary factors:**

1. **Generation cost increases in New England/New York:**
   - Source: Natural gas turbines
   - Natural gas prices increasing
   
2. **Demand increasing:**
   - Growing electricity consumption
   - Technology expansion (AI, EVs)
   - Population growth

**Result:** Higher prices for imported electricity in U.S. markets

---

## SEASONAL PRICING STRATEGY

### Optimal Export Timing

**Prices highest:**
- **January and February** (winter peak demand)
- Secondary peaks: July and August (summer cooling demand)

**Prices lowest:**
- Spring months (April/May)
- Fall months (October/November)

### Strategic Reservoir Management

**The "Storage Battery" Strategy:**
1. Use reservoirs as huge storage batteries
2. Import cheap power when available (Churchill Falls at 0.3¢/kWh)
3. Save Quebec reservoir water
4. Generate from Quebec reservoirs when export prices highest
5. Export to U.S. at 15-26¢/kWh
6. Maximize profit spread

**Profit potential:** 50-80× cost

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Export Volume Trends

1. Total Quebec exports declining over time due to drought
2. U.S. exports declining faster than provincial exports
3. By June 2025: U.S. exports below provincial exports
4. Quebec exporting less than 5% of total power
5. U.S. exports down to ~1.5% of total power

### The Reversal

6. New England transmission lines now importing INTO Quebec (opposite of intended)
7. NL exports to New England increasing (filling Quebec's former role)
8. Heavy investment in U.S. transmission lines "not really being used"

### Pricing Dynamics

9. Clear seasonal pricing pattern: peaks in January/February and July/August
10. Export prices ranging from $140-265/MWh (14-26.5¢/kWh)
11. Profit margins: 40-80× markup from production cost
12. Dynamic pricing creates arbitrage opportunities

### Strategic Implications

13. Hydro-Québec operates as profit maximizer in export markets
14. Despite volume declines, profits increasing due to price increases
15. Reservoir management strategy: save water, sell when prices peak
16. This strategy explains why cheap Churchill Falls power is so valuable
17. Can import cheap Churchill Falls power, export expensive Quebec power

### Data Challenges

18. Volume data fairly reliable
19. Price data sometimes inconsistent (Canada Energy Regulator)
20. Interprovincial trade prices not publicly available
