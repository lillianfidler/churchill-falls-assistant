            <h2>Methodology and Limitations</h2>
            
            <h3>How the Assistant Works</h3>
            <p>The Churchill Falls Information Assistant uses advanced language technology (Claude by Anthropic) to analyze and synthesize information from the curated knowledge base. When you ask a question:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The system searches all source documents for relevant information</li>
                <li>Multiple sources are cross-referenced to ensure accuracy</li>
                <li>Responses include specific citations with document names, dates, and links</li>
                <li>Different analytical perspectives are presented when they exist in the source materials</li>
                <li>The system clearly indicates when information is not available in the knowledge base</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What the Assistant Can Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain technical economic and legal concepts in accessible language</li>
                <li>Compare different analytical perspectives (e.g., Dr. May vs. Wade Locke)</li>
                <li>Provide specific citations with dates and video links</li>
                <li>Answer follow-up questions and maintain conversation context</li>
                <li>Adapt explanation depth based on user expertise level</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No External Sources:</strong> The assistant does not access information beyond its knowledge base. It cannot provide updates about events after the documents were created.</li>
                <li><strong>No Predictions:</strong> The assistant does not make predictions about future outcomes or events.</li>
                <li><strong>No Legal/Financial Advice:</strong> Responses are educational only and not professional advice.</li>
                <li><strong>Document-Bound:</strong> Analysis is limited to what is explicitly stated in the source materials.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
