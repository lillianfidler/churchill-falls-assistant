CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2023

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Shareholders of Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited (the "Company"), which comprise of the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023, and the consolidated statements of profit and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards (Canadian GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited (Churchill Falls) is incorporated under the laws of Canada and operates a hydroelectric generating plant and related transmission facilities in Labrador with a rated capacity of 5,428 megawatts. Churchill Falls operates under rights leased from the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (the Province) for 99 years, which are renewable for a further term of 99 years under the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited (Lease) Act, 1961 as amended, covering the water power potential of the Upper Churchill watershed. Energy from Churchill Falls is provided to two customers: Hydro-Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (Hydro). Churchill Falls is 65.8% owned by Hydro, whose parent company is Nalcor Energy (Nalcor). The remaining 34.2% is owned by Hydro-Québec. Effective June 18, 1999, the two shareholders of Churchill Falls, Hydro and Hydro-Québec, entered into a Shareholders' Agreement which provided, among other matters, that certain of the strategic operating, financing and investing policies of Churchill Falls be subject to joint approval by representatives of Hydro and Hydro-Québec. The head and corporate office for Churchill Falls is located at 500 Columbus Drive, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, A1B 3T5.

As of November 1, 2022, Churchill Falls held a 100% interest in Twin Falls Power Corporation Limited (Twin Falls). Effective December 18, 2023, Twin Falls was dissolved and the Board of Directors were released from their duties and responsibilities related to the company.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 Statement of Compliance and Basis of Measurement

These annual audited consolidated financial statements (financial statements) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial assets and financial liabilities which have been measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) which have been measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in Canadian Dollars and all values rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise noted. The financial statements were approved by Churchill Falls' Board of Directors on March 4, 2024.

2.2 Basis of Consolidation

The financial statements include the financial statements of Churchill Falls and its formerly wholly owned subsidiary Twin Falls up until its dissolution on December 18, 2023. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts on deposit with Schedule 1 Canadian Chartered banks, as well as highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Investments with maturities greater than three months and less than twelve months are classified as short-term investments.

2.4 Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing condition and location. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

2.5 Property, Plant and Equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes materials, labour, contracted services, professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized in accordance with Churchill Falls' accounting policy outlined in Note 2.7. Costs capitalized with the related asset include all those costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, Churchill Falls recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation rates. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repairs and maintenance costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income as incurred. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at the end of each year and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of all assets.

The depreciation rates used are as follows:
- Hydroelectric generation plant: 7 to 100 years
- Transmission and terminals: 7 to 70 years
- Service facilities and other: 3 to 55 years

Hydroelectric generation plant includes the powerhouse, turbines and generators, governors and exciters, and auxiliary systems, as well as water conveying and control structures, including dams, dikes, tailraces, surge chambers, penstocks and intake structures.

Transmission lines and terminal stations include support structures, foundations, conductors, and insulators associated with lines at voltages of 735, 230, and 69 kilovolt. Terminal station assets which are used to step up voltages of electricity for transmission and to step down voltages for distribution, provide switching and protection functions, and include auxiliary systems. Distribution system assets include poles, transformers, insulators, and conductors.

Service facilities and other include roads, telecontrol, buildings, airport, aircraft, vehicles, furniture, tools and equipment, and the town site, including municipal water and sanitary sewer systems.

The carrying amount of a replaced asset is derecognized when it is replaced. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recorded in other expense.

2.6 Intangible Assets

Assets that are expected to generate future economic benefit and are measurable, including computer software and technical service costs are capitalized as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 - Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each year, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
- Computer software: 7 to 10 years

2.7 Borrowing Costs

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. All other borrowing costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred.

2.8 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

Property, plant and equipment and other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, Churchill Falls estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Value in use is generally computed by reference to the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from non-financial assets. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income.

2.9 Employee Benefits Liability

(i) Pension Plan

Employees participate in the Province's Public Service Pension Plan, a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Contributions by Churchill Falls to this Plan are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Liabilities associated with this Plan are held with the Province.

(ii) Other Benefits

Churchill Falls provides group life insurance and health care benefits on a cost-shared basis to retired employees, in addition to a retirement allowance.

The cost of providing these benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations completed on an annual basis, based on service and Management's best estimate of salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs.

Actuarial gains and losses on Churchill Falls' defined benefit obligation are recognized in reserves in the period in which they occur. Past service costs are recognized in operating costs as incurred.

The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation.

2.10 Provisions

A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is recognized if Churchill Falls has a present legal obligation or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. The provision is measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. Provisions are re-measured at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date using the current discount rate.

2.11 Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Liabilities

Legal and constructive obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment are recorded as liabilities when those obligations are incurred and are measured as the present value of the expected costs to settle the liability, discounted at a rate specific to the liability. The liability is accreted up to the date the liability will be incurred with a corresponding charge to net finance income. The carrying amount of decommissioning, restoration and environmental liabilities is reviewed annually with changes in the estimates of timing or amount of cash flows added to or deducted from the cost of the related asset or expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income if the liability is short-term in nature.

2.12 Revenue Recognition

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Churchill Falls recognizes revenue from contracts with customers related to the sale of electricity, capacity and telecommunication services. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Churchill Falls recognizes revenue when it satisfies its performance obligation to the customer. Sales to customers are in accordance with rates under the terms of the applicable contracts.

2.13 Leasing

Lessee Accounting

Churchill Falls assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. Churchill Falls recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets. For these leases, Churchill Falls recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, Churchill Falls uses its incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
- fixed (and in-substance) lease payments, less any lease incentives
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate
- payments expected under residual value guarantees and payments relating to purchase options and renewal option periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised (or periods subject to termination options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised)

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Lease liabilities are remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use assets, when there is a change in variable lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or when Churchill Falls changes its assessment of whether purchase, renewal or termination options will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Whenever Churchill Falls incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognized and measured under IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The costs are included in the related right-of-use asset.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that Churchill Falls expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognized as an expense in operating costs in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. Churchill Falls has elected to apply this practical expedient.

2.14 Foreign Currencies

Transactions in currencies other than Churchill Falls' functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized using the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction, approximated by the prior month end close rate. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the period end date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income as Other expense.

2.15 Income Taxes

Churchill Falls is exempt from paying income taxes under Paragraph 149(1)(d.2) of the Income Tax Act.

2.16 Financial Instruments

Classification and Initial Measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when Churchill Falls becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are initially measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified at amortized cost, FVTOCI, FVTPL or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge. Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, amortized cost or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Financial Assets at Amortized Cost

Financial assets with contractual cash flows arising on specified dates, consisting solely of principal and interest, and that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.

Churchill Falls' financial assets at amortized cost include cash, restricted cash and trade and other receivables.

Financial Assets at FVTOCI

Financial assets measured at FVTOCI are those that have contractual cash flows arising on specific dates, consisting solely of principal and interest, and that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the financial asset. Any change in the carrying amount of these assets other than foreign exchange gains and losses, impairment gains and losses and interest income are recognized in other comprehensive income accumulated in the fair value reserve. When these assets are derecognized, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

Churchill Falls' financial assets measured at FVTOCI include reserve fund investments.

Financial assets at FVTPL

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss. Churchill Falls does not currently have financial assets measured at FVTPL.

Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost

Churchill Falls subsequently measures all financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liability is derecognized.

Churchill Falls' financial liabilities at amortized cost include trade and other payables and rental and royalty payable.

Financial Liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. Churchill Falls does not currently have financial liabilities measured at FVTPL.

Derecognition of Financial Instruments

Churchill Falls derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.

Churchill Falls derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, its obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.

Impairment of Financial Assets

Churchill Falls recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

Churchill Falls always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade and other receivables. The ECL on these financial assets are estimated based on Churchill Falls' historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. Churchill Falls also records 12-month ECL for those financial assets which have low credit risk and where the low credit risk exemption has been applied. The classes of financial assets that have been identified to have low credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and the reserve fund.

For all other financial instruments, Churchill Falls recognizes lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, Churchill Falls measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognized is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring.

Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

2.17 Government Grants

Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that Churchill Falls will comply with the associated conditions and that the grants will be received.

Government grants are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which Churchill Falls recognizes the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that Churchill Falls should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognized as deferred contributions in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and transferred to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the related assets.

Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to Churchill Falls with no future related costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income in the period in which they become receivable.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is reviewed if the revision affects only that period or in future periods.

3.1 Use of Judgment

(i) Asset Impairment and Reversals

Churchill Falls applies judgment in evaluating impairment and impairment reversal indicators based on various internal and external factors.

The recoverable amount of a CGU or asset is determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Management uses judgment in selecting discount rates and considering the occurrence of future events when determining the recoverable amount. Changes in these factors will affect the recoverable amount of CGUs and assets, which may result in a material adjustment to their carrying value.

(ii) Property, Plant and Equipment

Churchill Falls' accounting policy relating to property, plant and equipment is described in Note 2.5. In applying this policy, judgment is used in determining whether certain costs are additions to the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as opposed to repairs and maintenance. If an asset has been developed, judgment is required to identify the point at which the asset is capable of being used as intended and to identify the directly attributable borrowing costs to be included in the carrying value of the development asset. Judgment is also used in determining the appropriate componentization structure for Churchill Falls' property, plant and equipment.

(iii) Determination of CGUs

Churchill Falls' accounting policy relating to impairment of non-financial assets is described in Note 2.8. In applying this policy, Churchill Falls groups assets into the smallest identifiable groups for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Judgment is used in determining the level at which cash flows are largely independent of other assets or groups of assets.

(iv) Discount Rates

Certain of Churchill Falls' financial liabilities are discounted using discount rates that are subject to Management's judgment.

3.2 Use of Estimates

(i) Property, Plant and Equipment

Amounts recorded for depreciation are based on the useful lives of Churchill Falls' assets. The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are determined by independent specialists and reviewed annually by Churchill Falls. These useful lives are Management's best estimate of the service lives of these assets. Changes to these lives could materially affect the amount of depreciation recorded.

(ii) Decommissioning and Environmental Liabilities

Churchill Falls recognizes a liability for the fair value of the future expenditures required to settle obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Decommissioning liabilities are recorded as a liability at fair value, with a corresponding increase to property, plant and equipment. Accretion of decommissioning liabilities is included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income through net finance income. Differences between the recorded decommissioning liabilities and the actual decommissioning costs incurred are recorded as a gain or loss in the settlement period. The fair value of future expenditures required to settle obligations associated with environmental liabilities are recognized to the extent that they are reasonably estimated and are recorded at fair value.

(iii) Employee Future Benefits

Churchill Falls provides group life insurance and health care benefits on a cost-shared basis to retired employees, in addition to a severance payment upon retirement. The expected cost of providing these other employee benefits is accounted for on an accrual basis, and has been actuarially determined using the projected unit credit method prorated on service, and Management's best estimate of salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs.

4. CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a list of standards/interpretations that have been issued and are effective for accounting periods commencing on or after January 1, 2023, as specified.

- Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)
- Amendments to IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)
- Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current and Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with earlier application permitted)

4.1 Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Disclosure of Accounting Policies

The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1, which change the requirements with regard to the disclosure of accounting policies. The amendments replace all instances of the term 'significant accounting policies' with 'material accounting policy information'. Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements. This change did not have a material impact on Churchill Falls' financial statements.

4.2 Amendments to IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – Definition of Accounting Estimates

The IASB issued amendments to IAS 8 to clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. The amendments are intended to improve the understanding of the existing requirements and therefore did not have an impact on Churchill Falls' financial statements.

4.3 Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current and Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants

The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies determine whether, in the Statement of Financial Position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classified as current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non-current. The classification is based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period and specify that classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability. Additional information was added to clarify that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. In addition, an entity has to disclose information in the notes that enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that non-current liabilities with covenants could become repayable within 12 months. The amendments are applied retrospectively upon adoption. The application of these amendments is not expected to have a material impact on Churchill Falls' financial statements.

5. DISSOLUTION OF SUBSIDIARY

Effective December 18, 2023, Twin Falls was dissolved and the Board of Directors were released from their duties and responsibilities related to the company. As of the date of dissolution, any remaining assets and liabilities of Twin Falls, including environmental liabilities (and any responsibility to remediate them), were effectively transferred and are now the responsibility of Churchill Falls per the dissolution agreement signed November 1, 2023.

9. RESERVE FUND

Under the Shareholders' Agreement, Churchill Falls is required to maintain a $75.0 million segregated reserve fund to contribute towards the funding of capital expenditures related to Churchill Falls' existing facilities and their replacement. In 2023, $0.9 million was withdrawn from (2022 - $13.1 million invested into) the fund to maintain the $75.0 million in accordance with the Shareholders' Agreement.

This fund must remain in place until the end of the Shareholders' Agreement in 2041. Any amounts removed to fund capital expenditures must be replaced. Reserve fund holdings consist of securities issued by the Government of Canada, various provinces of Canada and Schedule 1 and 2 Canadian Chartered Banks.

The reserve fund movements during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

As at December 31 (thousands of Canadian dollars)          2023        2022

11. DECOMMISSIONING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

Churchill Falls has recognized liabilities associated with the disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB). The reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of the decommissioning and environmental liabilities as at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

As at December 31 (thousands of Canadian dollars)          2023        2022
Balance, beginning of the year                             3,920       619
Additions                                                  -           3,400
Accretion                                                  28          12
Liabilities settled                                        (1,429)     (72)
Revisions                                                  (139)       (39)

The total estimated undiscounted cash flows required to settle the PCB obligations at December 31, 2023 are $2.4 million (2022 - $4.0 million). The fair value of the decommissioning liabilities was determined using the present value of future cash flows discounted at the Company's credit adjusted risk free rate of 5.1% (2022 - 5.5%). Payments to settle the liabilities are expected to occur between 2024 and 2025. The current portion relates to estimated settlements within the next twelve months.

12. DEFERRED CREDITS

The deferred credits relate to Churchill Falls' obligation to provide required telecommunications services to Hydro-Québec in exchange for significant upgrades to the microwave telecommunications equipment linking the Churchill Falls Generating Station to Hydro-Québec's transmission system. On November 4, 2022, Churchill Falls received legal title to the assets in consideration for providing telecommunications services to Hydro-Québec over the term of the contract ending August 31, 2041. The deferred credit will be recognized in Other income evenly over the contract term as Churchill Falls satisfies its performance obligation.

Total benefit expense for the year                         1,957       2,608

The significant actuarial assumptions used in measuring the accrued benefit obligations and benefit expenses are as follows:

                                                           2023        2022

19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

19.1 Fair Value

The estimated fair values of financial instruments as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are based on relevant market prices and information available at the time. Fair value estimates are based on valuation techniques which are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the amount and timing of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting various degrees of risk. As such, the fair value estimates below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Churchill Falls might receive or incur in actual market transactions.

As a significant number of Churchill Falls' assets and liabilities do not meet the definition of a financial instrument, the fair value estimates below do not reflect the fair value of Churchill Falls as a whole.

Establishing Fair Value

Financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the nature of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

Level 1 - valuation based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - valuation techniques based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 - valuation techniques using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market inputs whenever such inputs exist. A financial instrument is classified to the lowest level of the hierarchy for which a significant input has been considered in measuring fair value. For assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, Churchill Falls determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022.

As at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Churchill Falls did not have any Level 3 instruments.

The fair values of cash, restricted cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and rental and royalty payable approximate their carrying values due to their short-term maturity.

The fair values of Level 2 financial instruments are determined using quoted prices in active markets, which in some cases are adjusted for factors specific to the asset or liability. Level 2 fair values of other risk management assets and liabilities are determined using observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices, such as interest rate yield curves and currency rates.

19.2 Risk Management

Churchill Falls is exposed to certain credit, liquidity and market risks through its operating, financing and investing activities. Financial risk is managed in accordance with a Board approved policy, which outlines the objectives and strategies for the management of financial risk, including the use of derivative contracts. Permitted financial risk management strategies are aimed at minimizing the volatility of Churchill Falls' expected future cash flows.

Credit Risk

Expected future cash flows are exposed to credit risk through operating activities, primarily due to the potential for non-performance by customers, and through investing activities, based on the risk of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments. The degree of exposure on cash, restricted cash, the reserve fund and energy sales including associated accounts receivable, is determined by the financial capacity and stability of those customers and counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk on these financial instruments is represented by their carrying values on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the reporting date.

Credit exposure on trade and other receivables is limited, as Churchill Falls' two main customers Hydro and Hydro-Québec, are investment grade utilities. As at December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts associated with these customers included in trade and other receivables (2022 - $nil).

Credit risk on cash and restricted cash is limited, as Churchill Falls' cash deposits are held by a Schedule 1 Canadian Chartered bank with a rating of A+ (Standard and Poor's).

Credit exposure on the reserve fund is mitigated by adhering to an investment policy which restricts the holdings to long-term debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Government of Canada or any province of Canada. Investment in the long-term debt instruments of Canadian banks are also permitted, provided the bank is rated A or higher by Standard and Poor's. With the exception of Government of Canada, holdings of any one issuer are limited to 10% of the total principal amount of the portfolio.

The following credit risk table provides information on credit exposures according to issuer type and credit rating for the reserve fund:

Liquidity Risk

Churchill Falls is exposed to liquidity risk with respect to its contractual obligations and financial liabilities. Churchill Falls manages this risk by maintaining borrowing facilities, a minimum cash balance of $25.0 million (2022 - $24.0 million) and business interruption insurance. Short-term liquidity is provided through cash on hand, funds from operations and a $10.0 million (2022 - $10.0 million) unsecured credit facility. Long-term liquidity risk is managed by maintenance of the reserve fund in accordance with the Shareholders' Agreement and a dividend management policy that meets long-term liquidity requirements associated with Churchill Falls' capital expenditure program.

The following are the contractual maturities of Churchill Falls' financial liabilities, including principal and interest, as at December 31, 2023.

Market Risk

In carrying out its operating and investing activities, Churchill Falls is exposed to possible market price movements that could impact expected future cash flow and the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities. Market price movements to which Churchill Falls has significant exposure include those relating to prevailing interest rates.

Interest Rates

Changes in prevailing interest rates will impact the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as FVTOCI, which includes the reserve fund. Expected future cash flows from these assets and liabilities are also impacted in certain circumstances, such as when reserve fund securities are sold prior to maturity.

The impact of a 0.5% change in interest rates associated with the reserve fund on Other Comprehensive Income is as follows:

(thousands of Canadian dollars)                             Decrease    Increase

(b) Churchill Falls is subject to legal claims with respect to impact on land use, energy and capacity delivery, construction and other various matters. For some legal claims, it is not possible at this time to predict with any certainty the outcome of such litigation. Should these claims result in an unfavourable outcome for Churchill Falls, they may have a significant adverse effect on Churchill Falls' financial position.

(c) The Water Management Agreement between Churchill Falls and Muskrat Falls provides for coordinated production for the efficient use of water on the Churchill River system by ensuring that water is available to meet delivery requirements and contractual commitments for both Churchill Falls and Muskrat Falls, while maximizing the energy produced from the water resource. As at December 31, 2023, Muskrat Falls has stored the equivalent of approximately 2.0 TWh (2022 – 1.5 TWh) of energy in the Churchill Falls reservoir.

22. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Churchill Falls' objective when managing capital is to maintain its ability to continue as a going concern. Churchill Falls' requirements for capital in the future are expected to remain consistent, in line with the aging of the plant and related infrastructure and the execution of the long-term asset management plan. The focus of the capital management policy is to provide flexibility to ensure cash continues to be available to satisfy capital requirements. Managing the level of common dividend payments is a key aspect of ensuring the availability of funding to maintain the plant and infrastructure.

At present, the capital position of Churchill Falls is comprised entirely of equity capital (issued capital, shareholder contributions, reserves and retained earnings). The capital structure is adjusted through the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.

Churchill Falls maintains a $10.0 million Canadian or US equivalent unsecured operating credit facility with its banker. Advances may take the form of a Prime Rate advance or the issuance of a Bankers' Acceptance (BA) with interest calculated at the Prime Rate or prevailing Government BA Fee. The facility provides coverage for overdrafts on Churchill Falls' bank accounts, with interest calculated at the Prime Rate. There were no amounts drawn on this facility as at December 31, 2023 (2022 - $nil).

Churchill Falls has issued three irrevocable letters of credit totalling $2.0 million (2022 – $2.0 million), $1.0 million of which does not impact the borrowing limit of the operating credit facility (2022 - $1.0 million). The letters of credit ensure satisfactory management of its waste management system and compliance with a certificate of approval for the transportation of special and hazardous wastes, granted by the Provincial Department of Environment and Conservation.
