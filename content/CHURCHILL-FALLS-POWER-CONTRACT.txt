"Debt Service Requirement" means, in respect of any period, the sum of the aggregate amount required to be paid by CFLCo in such period on account of principal, interest, mandatory sinking fund instalments (applicable premium included), indemnification payments, applicable federal and provincial tax payments, and all other mandatory payments in such period on all outstanding Debt Obligations incurred by CFLCo for the financing of the construction and bringing into operation of the Plant or for the refinancing from time to time of Debt Obligations originally incurred to finance or refinance such construction and bringing into operation, except that as regards any such outstanding Debt Obligations the maturity of which shall be or have become accelerated, only as if such acceleration had not occurred.
