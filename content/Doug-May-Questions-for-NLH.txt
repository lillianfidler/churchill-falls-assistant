Some Questions for NLH
Related to the MOU

Some Questions for NHL, HQ, &GNL
• The general understanding is that CF electricity is about 15% of HQ’s
total available electricity.
• Is this true?
• For each month since January 2015, what amount of electricity has CF(L)Co sold to HQ,
and for how much?
• When HQ reported that the cost of imported power for the first half of
2025 at five cents per kWh, did that include the low-cost electricity
from CF? HQ would know the details.
• Which other provinces does HQ import power from? How much for
each month and what does HQ pay for the power?
• What is the AC of power from CF? How has the AC changed over the
past 20 years?
• What are the transmission costs per MWh for CF power going to the NE
grid and to the NY grid?

• Does HQ own part of the transmission system in NY and NE through
which this power is transferred to the wholesale markets in NE and
NY? If so, what are the transmission costs per MWh?
• Has drought affected the water levels of the Smallwood Reservoir?
• How will the proposed generating projects in the MOU affect the
volume of water in the Smallwood Reservoir?
• Does the cost of producing power at CF increase during those
months when more power is produced? (Economist speak for
estimates of marginal costs)
• What are CF(L)Co’s estimates of depreciation and maintenance
costs for the existing plant at CF (no upgrades) for each year in the
period 2025-2071?

• Are there outstanding capital asset costs or debt costs associated
with the existing plant at CF?
• A Quebec electricity expert noted that in 2022, about 12% of the
electricity available to HQ was exported, which was close to the
amount imported from CF. Is there a connection?
• HQ states in its 2025 mid-year report that sales of about 6 TWh (6
million megawatts) occurred in the first 6 months, roughly equal to
the volume of purchases. Details?
• NHL informed me that water rental rates and royalties were being
“modernized”. Has an agreement been reached? If yes, how were
these rates determined?
•

• To find the implicit rental value of water from CF, determine the average cost
per MWh of electricity generated there. This aggregate cost would include
capital (K), labour (L), purchased materials (M) directly needed for production,
and services (S) directly required for production. Water royalties and rents
would NOT be included. What are these AC for CF power? NHL has the answer.
• Walter Parsons (NHL) emphasizes that 5.9¢/kWh is the base price for
determining new prices for existing power in the MOU. His original explanation
of how this price was determined has changed. Where does this price come
from? The GNL seems to suggest that it is tied to electricity prices in the New
England and New York markets. Is it?

• What is the life-expectancy of the CF dam, knowing that the
normal range is 50-100 years?
• In its third Quarterly Bulletin, Third Quarter 2025, Hydro-Quebec
states that it manages “its large reservoirs prudently and
dynamically” p.3. What does this mean in terms of hydroelectric
generation? How is this management approach applied to the
Smallwood Reservoir?
