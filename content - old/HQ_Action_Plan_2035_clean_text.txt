===== CRITICAL STATEMENTS ABOUT ENERGY SOURCES =====

ON WIND AND SOLAR (Variable Generation):
HQ states: "Of the different options available to increase energy in Québec, these choices are the most advantageous in terms of rapid rollout, cost and social acceptability"

However, HQ notes limitations:
- "The electricity generated by variable sources, such as wind and solar, fluctuates as it is dependent on weather conditions (such as wind force and sunlight)"
- "We can't control the wind or the behavior of our customers, these solutions alone are not enough"

ON HYDROPOWER (Firm Generation):
HQ provides definition: "To ensure the reliability of the power supply, especially during peak periods, Hydro-Québec must include in its energy and capacity balances a sufficient quantity of electricity from firm generation sources like hydropower, which can be mobilized as needed"

HQ states: "The best choice by far at times like these is hydropower"

PEAK DEMAND SCENARIO:
HQ provides example: "We need only imagine a cold and windless winter day, when thousands of households turn up the heat and start preparing supper. It is in cases like these, when a high number of customers are consuming a lot of electricity at the same time, that capacity needs are at their highest"

HQ concludes: "By managing our reservoirs optimally, we can ensure that we have enough water to produce the electricity we need, when we need it"

STRATEGIC STATEMENT:
"That's why our strategy must include sufficient hydropower capacity to meet demand when energy efficiency and wind power are not enough"
