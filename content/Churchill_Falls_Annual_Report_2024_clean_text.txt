Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Shareholders of Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited
(the “Company”), which comprise of the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31,
2024, and the consolidated statements of profit and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash
flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material
accounting policy information (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as at December 31, 2024, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the
year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (“IASB”).

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards
(“Canadian GAAS”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the
Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the
Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB, and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian GAAS, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
●

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.

●

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

●

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

●

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue
as a going concern.

●

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation.

●

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

a hydroelectric generating plant and related transmission facilities in Labrador with a rated capacity of 5,428
megawatts. Churchill Falls operates under rights leased from the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (the
Province) for 99 years, which are renewable for a further term of 99 years under the Churchill Falls (Labrador)
Corporation Limited (Lease) Act, 1961 as amended, covering the water power potential of the Upper Churchill
watershed. Energy from Churchill Falls is provided to two customers: Hydro-Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador
Hydro (Hydro). Churchill Falls is 65.8% owned by Hydro, whose parent company is Nalcor Energy (Nalcor). The
remaining 34.2% is owned by Hydro-Québec. Effective June 18, 1999, the two shareholders of Churchill Falls, Hydro
and Hydro-Québec, entered into a Shareholders' Agreement which provided, among other matters, that certain of the
strategic operating, financing and investing policies of Churchill Falls be subject to joint approval by representatives of
Hydro and Hydro-Québec. The head and corporate office for Churchill Falls is located at 500 Columbus Drive, St. John’s,
Newfoundland and Labrador, A1B 3T5.
Churchill Falls held a 100% interest in Twin Falls Power Corporation Limited (Twin Falls). Effective December 18, 2023,
Twin Falls was dissolved.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1

Statement of Compliance and Basis of Measurement
These annual audited consolidated financial statements (financial statements) have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS® Accounting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial assets and financial
liabilities which have been measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) which have been measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in
Canadian Dollars and all values rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise noted. The financial
statements were approved by Churchill Falls’ Board of Directors on March 3, 2025.

2.2

Basis of Consolidation
The financial statements include the financial statements of Churchill Falls and its formerly wholly owned subsidiary
Twin Falls up until its dissolution on December 18, 2023. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
upon consolidation.

2.3

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts on deposit with Schedule 1 Canadian Chartered banks, as well as highly
liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Investments with maturities greater than three months and
less than twelve months are classified as short‐term investments.

2.4

Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis
and includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing condition and
location. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of
completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

2.5

Property, Plant and Equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses. Cost includes materials, labour, contracted services, professional fees and, for qualifying assets,
borrowing costs capitalized in accordance with Churchill Falls’ accounting policy outlined in Note 2.7. Costs capitalized
with the related asset include all those costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.

CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, Churchill Falls
recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation rates. Likewise, when a major
inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repairs and maintenance costs are recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income as incurred. Depreciation commences when the assets
are ready for their intended use. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at the end of each year and adjusted
prospectively, if appropriate. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of all
assets.
At December 31, 2024, the depreciation lives used are as follows:
Hydroelectric generation plant
Transmission and terminals
Service facilities and other

15 to 110 years
18 to 65 years
3 to 75 years

Hydroelectric generation plant includes the powerhouse, turbines and generators, governors and exciters, and
auxiliary systems, as well as water conveying and control structures, including dams, dikes, tailraces, surge chambers,
penstocks and intake structures.
Transmission lines and terminal stations include support structures, foundations, conductors, and insulators associated
with lines at voltages of 735, 230, and 69 kilovolt. Terminal station assets which are used to step up voltages of
electricity for transmission and to step down voltages for distribution, provide switching and protection functions, and
include auxiliary systems. Distribution system assets include poles, transformers, insulators, and conductors.
Service facilities and other include roads, telecontrol, buildings, airport, aircraft, vehicles, furniture, tools and
equipment, and the town site, including municipal water and sanitary sewer systems.
The carrying amount of a replaced asset is derecognized when it is replaced. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of
property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of
property, plant and equipment and are recorded in other expense.
2.6

Intangible Assets
Assets that are expected to generate future economic benefit and are measurable, including computer software and
technical service costs are capitalized as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 - Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment
losses. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each year, with the effect of any
changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried
at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Computer software

2.7

7 years

Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are
assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those
assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned
on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from
the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. All other borrowing costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred.

CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.8

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Property, plant and equipment and other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, Churchill Falls estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount is the
higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Value in use is generally computed by reference to the
present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from non-financial assets. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows
have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of
the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income.

2.9

Employee Benefits Liability
(i)

Pension Plan
Employees participate in the Province’s Public Service Pension Plan, a multi-employer defined benefit plan.
Contributions by Churchill Falls to this Plan are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service
entitling them to the contributions. Liabilities associated with this Plan are held with the Province.

(ii)

Other Benefits
Churchill Falls provides group life insurance and health care benefits on a cost-shared basis to retired employees,
in addition to a retirement allowance.
The cost of providing these benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
valuations completed on an annual basis, based on service and Management's best estimate of salary escalation,
retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs.
Actuarial gains and losses on Churchill Falls’ defined benefit obligation are recognized in reserves in the period
in which they occur. Past service costs are recognized in operating costs as incurred.
The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position represents the
present value of the defined benefit obligation.

2.10 Provisions
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is recognized if Churchill Falls has a present legal
obligation or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future
operating losses. The provision is measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditures expected to
be required to settle the obligation using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the obligation. Provisions are re-measured at each Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position date using the current discount rate.
2.11 Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Liabilities
Legal and constructive obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment are recorded as
liabilities when those obligations are incurred and are measured as the present value of the expected costs to settle
the liability, discounted at a rate specific to the liability. The liability is accreted up to the date the liability will be
incurred with a corresponding charge to net finance income. The carrying amount of decommissioning, restoration
and environmental liabilities is reviewed annually with changes in the estimates of timing or amount of cash flows
added to or deducted from the cost of the related asset or expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and
Comprehensive Income if the liability is short-term in nature.

CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.12 Revenue Recognition
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Churchill Falls recognizes revenue from contracts with customers related to the sale of electricity, capacity and
telecommunication services. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer
and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Churchill Falls recognizes revenue when it satisfies its
performance obligation to the customer. Deferred revenue is recognized when contractual payments are received
before satisfying the related performance obligation.
2.13 Leasing
Lessee Accounting
Churchill Falls assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. Churchill Falls recognizes a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee,
except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets.
For these leases, Churchill Falls recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic
benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined,
Churchill Falls uses its incremental borrowing rate.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
•
•
•

fixed (and in-substance) lease payments, less any lease incentives;
variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; and
payments expected under residual value guarantees and payments relating to purchase options and
renewal option periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised (or periods subject to termination
options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised).

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Lease liabilities
are remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use assets, when there is a change in variable
lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or when Churchill Falls changes its assessment of whether
purchase, renewal or termination options will be exercised.
Churchill Falls did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.
The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at
or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Whenever Churchill Falls incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on
which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease,
a provision is recognized and measured under IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The
costs are included in the related right-of-use asset.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If
a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that Churchill Falls
expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying
asset. Depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

-4-

CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and
the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognized as an expense in operating costs in the period in which
the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.
As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any
lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. Churchill Falls has elected to apply this practical
expedient.
2.14 Foreign Currencies
Transactions in currencies other than Churchill Falls’ functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized using the
exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction, approximated by the prior month end close rate. At the end of
each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange in
effect at the period end date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Comprehensive Income as Other expense.
2.15 Income Taxes
Churchill Falls is exempt from paying income taxes under Paragraph 149(1) (d.2) of the Income Tax Act.
2.16 Financial Instruments
Classification and Initial Measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when
Churchill Falls becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified at amortized cost, FVTOCI, FVTPL or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in
an effective hedge. Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, amortized cost or as
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to
the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at
FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on
initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at
FVTPL are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
Financial Assets at Amortized Cost
Financial assets with contractual cash flows arising on specified dates, consisting solely of principal and interest, and
that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows are subsequently
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses
are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.
Churchill Falls’ financial assets at amortized cost include cash, restricted cash and trade and other receivables.
Financial Assets at FVTOCI
Financial assets measured at FVTOCI are those that have contractual cash flows arising on specific dates, consisting
solely of principal and interest, and that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual
cash flows and to sell the financial asset. Any change in the carrying amount of these assets other than foreign
exchange gains and losses, impairment gains and losses and interest income are recognized in other comprehensive
income accumulated in the fair value reserve. When these assets are derecognized, the cumulative gains or losses
previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
Churchill Falls’ financial assets measured at FVTOCI include reserve fund investments.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or
losses recognized in profit or loss. Churchill Falls does not currently have financial assets measured at FVTPL.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost
Churchill Falls subsequently measures all financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liability is derecognized.
Churchill Falls’ financial liabilities at amortized cost include trade and other payables and rental and royalty payable.
Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at
FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value
gains or losses recognized in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. Churchill
Falls does not currently have financial liabilities measured at FVTPL.
Derecognition of Financial Instruments
Churchill Falls derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another
party.
Churchill Falls derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, its obligations are discharged, cancelled or have
expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid
and payable is recognized in profit or loss.
Impairment of Financial Assets
Churchill Falls recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on investments in debt instruments that are
measured at amortized cost or at FVTOCI. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in
credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.
Churchill Falls always recognizes lifetime ECL for trade and other receivables. The ECL on these financial assets are
estimated based on Churchill Falls’ historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors,
general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at
the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. Churchill Falls also records 12-month ECL for
those financial assets which have low credit risk and where the low credit risk exemption has been applied. The classes
of financial assets that have been identified to have low credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
the reserve fund.
For all other financial instruments, Churchill Falls recognizes lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in
credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased
significantly since initial recognition, Churchill Falls measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an
amount equal to 12-month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognized is based on significant
increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition instead of on evidence of a financial
asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring.
Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial
instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default
events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
2.17 Government Grants
Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that Churchill Falls will comply with the
associated conditions and that the grants will be received.

-6-

CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Government grants are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which Churchill Falls
recognizes the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose
primary condition is that Churchill Falls should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are
recognized as deferred contributions in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and transferred to the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives
of the related assets.
Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of
giving immediate financial support to Churchill Falls with no future related costs are recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income in the period in which they become receivable.

3.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards requires
Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ materially from these
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is reviewed if the revision affects only that period or in
future periods.

3.1

Use of Judgment
(i) Asset Impairment and Reversals
Churchill Falls applies judgment in evaluating impairment and impairment reversal indicators based on various
internal and external factors.
The recoverable amount of a CGU or asset is determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal
and its value in use. Management uses judgment in selecting discount rates and considering the occurrence of
future events when determining the recoverable amount. Changes in these factors will affect the recoverable
amount of CGUs and assets, which may result in a material adjustment to their carrying value.
(ii) Property, Plant and Equipment
Churchill Falls’ accounting policy relating to property, plant and equipment is described in Note 2.5. In applying
this policy, judgment is used in determining whether certain costs are additions to the carrying amount of the
property, plant and equipment as opposed to repairs and maintenance. If an asset has been developed, judgment
is required to identify the point at which the asset is capable of being used as intended and to identify the directly
attributable borrowing costs to be included in the carrying value of the development asset. Judgment is also used
in determining the appropriate componentization structure for Churchill Falls’ property, plant and equipment.
(iii) Determination of CGUs
Churchill Falls’ accounting policy relating to impairment of non-financial assets is described in Note 2.8. In applying
this policy, Churchill Falls groups assets into the smallest identifiable groups for which cash flows are largely
independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Judgment is used in determining the level at
which cash flows are largely independent of other assets or groups of assets.
(iv) Discount Rates
Certain of Churchill Falls’ financial liabilities are discounted using discount rates that are subject to Management’s
judgment.

-7-

CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3.2

Use of Estimates
(i) Property, Plant and Equipment
Amounts recorded for depreciation are based on the useful lives of Churchill Falls’ assets. The useful lives of
property, plant and equipment are determined by independent specialists and reviewed annually by Churchill
Falls. These useful lives are Management’s best estimate of the service lives of these assets. Changes to these lives
could materially affect the amount of depreciation recorded.
(ii) Decommissioning and Environmental Liabilities
Churchill Falls recognizes a liability for the fair value of the future expenditures required to settle obligations
associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Decommissioning liabilities are recorded as a
liability at fair value, with a corresponding increase to property, plant and equipment. Accretion of
decommissioning liabilities is included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income
through net finance income. Differences between the recorded decommissioning liabilities and the actual
decommissioning costs incurred are recorded as a gain or loss in the settlement period. The fair value of future
expenditures required to settle obligations associated with environmental liabilities are recognized to the extent
that they are reasonably estimated and are recorded at fair value.
(iii) Employee Future Benefits
Churchill Falls provides group life insurance and health care benefits on a cost-shared basis to retired employees,
in addition to a severance payment upon retirement. The expected cost of providing these other employee
benefits is accounted for on an accrual basis, and has been actuarially determined using the projected unit credit
method prorated on service, and Management’s best estimate of salary escalation, retirement ages of employees
and expected health care costs.

CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a list of applicable standards/interpretations that have been issued and are effective for accounting
periods commencing on or after January 1, 2024, as specified.
 Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current
and Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants1
 Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure – Contracts Referencing
Nature-dependent Electricity2
 IFRS 18 – Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements 3
1 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024.
2 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026, with earlier application permitted.
3 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027, with earlier application permitted.

4.1

Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current or NonCurrent and Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants
The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies
determine whether, in the Statement of Financial Position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date
should be classified as current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non-current. The classification
is based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period and specify that classification is unaffected
by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability. Additional information
was added to clarify that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date
affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. In addition, an entity has to disclose information in the
notes that enables users of the financial statements to understand the risk that non-current liabilities with covenants
could become repayable within 12 months. The amendments are applied retrospectively upon adoption. The
application of these amendments did not have a material impact on Churchill Falls’ financial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4.2

Amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosure – Contracts
Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 to provide a reasonable basis for an entity to determine the required
accounting for contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity which are often structured as power purchase
agreements. The amendments include clarifying the application of the ‘own-use’ requirements, permitting hedge
accounting if these contracts are used as hedging instruments, and adding new disclosure requirements to enable
investors to understand the effect of these contracts on a company’s financial performance and cash flows.
Management is currently assessing the potential impact on Churchill Falls’ financial statements.

4.3

IFRS 18 – Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements
IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1, carrying forward many of the requirements of IAS 1 unchanged and introducing new
requirements to present specified categories and defined subtotals in the statement of profit or loss. As well, entities
will be required to provide disclosures on management-defined performance measures in the notes to the financial
statements and improve aggregation and disaggregation. In addition, some IAS 1 paragraphs have been moved to IAS
8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and IFRS 7. Furthermore, the IASB has made minor
amendments to IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows.
An entity is required to apply IFRS 18 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, with earlier
application permitted. The amendments to IAS 7, as well as the revised IAS 8 and IFRS 7, become effective when an
entity applies IFRS 18. IFRS 18 requires retrospective application with specific transition provisions. Management is
currently assessing the potential impact on Churchill Falls’ financial statements.

5.

DISSOLUTION OF SUBSIDIARY
Effective December 18, 2023, Twin Falls was dissolved and the Board of Directors were released from their duties and
responsibilities related to the company. As of the date of dissolution, any remaining environmental liabilities of Twin
Falls (and any responsibility to remediate them), were effectively transferred and are now the responsibility of
Churchill Falls per the dissolution agreement signed November 1, 2023.
The Consolidated Statement of Profit and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes
Churchill Falls’ share of Twin Falls net revenue and expenditures for the period of January 1, 2023 through December
18, 2023. On December 18th, Twin Falls was dissolved and net assets of $2.3 million and associated gain of $0.8 million
were recorded in Churchill Falls.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value
The estimated fair values of financial instruments as at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are based on
relevant market prices and information available at the time. Fair value estimates are based on valuation techniques
which are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the amount and timing of future cash flows and
discount rates reflecting various degrees of risk. As such, the fair value estimates below are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts that Churchill Falls might receive or incur in actual market transactions.
As a significant number of Churchill Falls’ assets and liabilities do not meet the definition of a financial instrument, the
fair value estimates below do not reflect the fair value of Churchill Falls as a whole.
Establishing Fair Value
Financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the nature of the
inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1 - valuation based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - valuation techniques based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - valuation techniques using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).

- 16 -

CHURCHILL FALLS (LABRADOR) CORPORATION LIMITED
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market inputs whenever such inputs exist. A financial
instrument is classified to the lowest level of the hierarchy for which a significant input has been considered in
measuring fair value. For assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, Churchill Falls
determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorization (based on
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 during the period ended December 31, 2024 and the year ended
December 31, 2023.
As at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Churchill Falls did not have any Level 3 instruments.

The fair values of cash, restricted cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and rental and royalty
payable approximate their carrying values due to their short-term maturity.
The fair values of Level 2 financial instruments are determined using quoted prices in active markets, which in some
cases are adjusted for factors specific to the asset or liability. Level 2 fair values of other risk management assets and
liabilities are determined using observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices, such as interest rate yield
curves and currency rates.
21.2 Risk Management
Churchill Falls is exposed to certain credit, liquidity and market risks through its operating, financing and investing
activities. Financial risk is managed in accordance with a Board approved policy, which outlines the objectives and
strategies for the management of financial risk, including the use of derivative contracts. Permitted financial risk
management strategies are aimed at minimizing the volatility of Churchill Falls' expected future cash flows.
Credit Risk
Expected future cash flows are exposed to credit risk through operating activities, primarily due to the potential for
non-performance by customers, and through investing activities, based on the risk of non-performance by
counterparties to financial instruments. The degree of exposure on cash, restricted cash, the reserve fund and revenue
including associated accounts receivable, is determined by the financial capacity and stability of those customers and
counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk on these financial instruments is represented by their carrying
values on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the reporting date.
Credit exposure on trade and other receivables is limited, as Churchill Falls’ two main customers Hydro and HydroQuébec, are investment grade utilities. As at December 31, 2024, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts
associated with these customers included in trade and other receivables (2023 - $nil).
Credit risk on cash and restricted cash is limited, as Churchill Falls’ cash deposits are held by a Schedule 1 Canadian
Chartered bank with a rating of A+ (Standard and Poor’s).
Credit exposure on the reserve fund is mitigated by adhering to an investment policy which restricts the holdings to
long-term debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Government of Canada or any province of Canada. Investment
in the long-term debt instruments of Canadian banks are also permitted, provided the bank is rated A or higher by
Standard and Poor’s. With the exception of Government of Canada, holdings of any one issuer are limited to 10% of
the total principal amount of the portfolio. The following credit risk table provides information on credit exposures

Liquidity Risk
Churchill Falls is exposed to liquidity risk with respect to its contractual obligations and financial liabilities. Churchill
Falls manages this risk by maintaining borrowing facilities, a minimum cash balance of $25.0 million (2023 - $25.0
million) and business interruption insurance. Short-term liquidity is provided through cash on hand, funds from
operations and a $10.0 million (2023 - $10.0 million) unsecured credit facility. Long-term liquidity risk is managed by
maintenance of the reserve fund in accordance with the Shareholders’ Agreement and a dividend management policy
that meets long-term liquidity requirements associated with Churchill Falls’ capital expenditure program.
The following are the contractual maturities of Churchill Falls’ financial liabilities, including principal and interest, as at

Market Risk
In carrying out its operating and investing activities, Churchill Falls is exposed to possible market price movements that
could impact expected future cash flow and the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities. Market price
movements to which Churchill Falls has significant exposure include those relating to prevailing interest rates.
Interest Rates
Changes in prevailing interest rates will impact the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as FVTOCI,
which includes the reserve fund. Expected future cash flows from these assets and liabilities are also impacted in
certain circumstances, such as when reserve fund securities are sold prior to maturity.
The impact of a 0.5% change in interest rates associated with the reserve fund on Other Comprehensive Income is as

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Churchill Falls’ objective when managing capital is to maintain its ability to continue as a going concern. The focus of
the capital management policy is to provide flexibility to ensure cash continues to be available to satisfy capital
requirements. Managing the level of dividend payments is a key aspect of ensuring the availability of funding to
maintain the plant and infrastructure.
At present, the capital position of Churchill Falls is comprised entirely of equity capital (issued capital, shareholder
contributions, reserves and retained earnings). The capital structure is adjusted through the amount of dividends paid
to shareholders.
Churchill Falls maintains a $10.0 million Canadian or US equivalent unsecured operating credit facility with its banker.
Advances may take the form of a Prime Rate advance with interest calculated at the Prime Rate. The facility provides
coverage for overdrafts on Churchill Falls' bank accounts, with interest calculated at the Prime Rate. There were no
amounts drawn on this facility as at December 31, 2024 (2023 - $nil).
Churchill Falls has issued three irrevocable letters of credit totalling $2.0 million (2023 – $2.0 million), $1.0 million of
which does not impact the borrowing limit of the operating credit facility (2023 - $1.0 million). The letters of credit
ensure satisfactory management of its waste management system and compliance with a certificate of approval for
the transportation of special and hazardous wastes, granted by the Provincial Department of Environment and Climate.
