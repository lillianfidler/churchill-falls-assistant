WHY THIS TOPIC IS CRITICAL

Dr. May emphasizes that this is an extremely important part of the puzzle because water, the most important input into the generation project at Churchill Falls, is worth almost nothing under current arrangements.

PRODUCTION INPUTS AT HYDROELECTRIC STATIONS

The inputs for hydroelectric production include capital (the dam and turbines), labour (operations and maintenance staff), and other inputs such as purchased materials and services. These inputs are relatively fixed in the short and medium term and can be changed only in the longer term through proposed new infrastructure projects.

Water flow is the critical variable input. It can be controlled on hourly, daily, and seasonal bases depending on demand for electricity, though it can be limited during drought as is currently the case on La Grande Riviere in Quebec. Despite having the essential production value in hydroelectric generation, water costs almost nothing at Churchill Falls. The low cost of water combined with the amount of electricity from Churchill Falls available to Quebec play the primary role in explaining why Quebec has the lowest electricity costs in Canada and the G7.

EVIDENCE FROM CHURCHILL FALLS WATER ROYALTY ANALYSIS

Analysis of the CF(L)Co 2024 Annual Report from Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro shows total expenses of $113,963,000 or $113.963 million. Water royalties were $8,790,000 or $8.79 million, which compares to salaries and benefits of over $43 million (4.9 times water royalties) and maintenance of $12.7 million (1.4 times water royalties). Water is relatively inexpensive at Churchill Falls.

The Churchill Falls water royalty rate is 0.025 cents per kWh paid to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. This is not 1 cent, not 0.2 cents, but just 0.025 cents per kWh.

THE QUEBEC COMPARISON: 36 TIMES DISPARITY

Hydro-Quebec pays the Quebec government a water royalty of $9 per megawatt-hour, equivalent to 0.9 cents per kWh, indexed annually with changes around January 1st. The Government of Quebec receives approximately 36 times more for water royalty per kilowatt-hour than the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.

This makes Churchill Falls a very cheap source of power for Hydro-Quebec. One reason they want Churchill River projects is the potential to use Churchill River water with possibly the same water royalty rates, though there have been indications these rates will be modernized without clarification of what that means. Dr. May notes that like so much of the information, the specifics are really unknown to the general public.

ALTERNATIVE ROYALTY APPROACHES

METHOD 1: PRODUCTION-BASED ROYALTIES (QUEBEC MODEL)

If Quebec's $9 per megawatt-hour rate were applied to Churchill Falls assuming annual production of 34,500 megawatt-hours, the annual royalty revenue to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador would be $310.5 million. This goes directly to the government rather than to CF(L)Co. Currently NL receives $8.79 million annually. The Quebec rate would represent a 35 times increase in royalty revenue.

METHOD 2: SALES VALUE-BASED ROYALTIES

Basing water royalties on sales values of electricity faces two major problems in CF(L)Co's case. First, Hydro-Quebec is basically the only buyer, taking over 90% of Churchill Falls power in a monopsonistic market where the price CF(L)Co receives is basically determined by Hydro-Quebec. Second, Hydro-Quebec as a cost-minimizing public utility engages in what economic literature calls dissipation of rents, keeping costs and prices low to impact equalization payments. Hydro-Quebec does not take profit, and profit is not included as Quebec government revenue, so the Government of Quebec appears poorer than it actually is and receives higher federal equalization payments. Using this approach would result in very reduced royalties because the wholesale value is artificially suppressed.

METHOD 3: RESOURCE RENT-BASED ROYALTIES

This approach focuses on differential rents and scarcity rents. Differential rents would better capture true value but face problems because the price at the generation gate is not set in a competitive market but in a monopsonistic market with a single buyer, obscuring true market value. Price adjustments would need to be set in 2041 or could be set annually or indexed to encourage Hydro-Quebec to undertake other worthwhile projects like Gull Island, Churchill Falls enlargement, or turbine upgrades.

Critical information is missing for this approach. What is needed is the unit cost of the lowest-cost new facilities that can produce exactly the same amount of power as the proposed infrastructure projects. Dr. May requested this information from Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro as far back as February but is still waiting for an answer. Additionally, the calculation must capture seasonal changes in prices and prices in free export markets, since resource rents in a competitive environment would change month to month. Dr. May assesses that this requires significant thought and discussion because the proposed Churchill River projects operate in a market environment much more complex than simple theoretical microeconomic models.

SUMMARY OF ROYALTY OPTIONS

The current system charges 0.025 cents per kWh generating approximately $8.79 million annually for NL, with water worth almost nothing. The Quebec production model at 0.9 cents per kWh (36 times the current NL rate) would generate $310.5 million annually, capturing production value though possibly still not full market value. The sales value model based on Quebec wholesale electricity value would result in very reduced royalties because values are artificially suppressed by Hydro-Quebec's cost-minimization strategy. The resource rent model based on differential and scarcity rents is theoretically superior, reflecting competitive market values and seasonal price variations while considering opportunity costs, but it is practically difficult requiring competitive market pricing that is not available, cost data for alternative projects that has not been provided, accounting for export market dynamics, and complex calculation and administration.

KEY IMPLICATIONS

The water royalty disparity is enormous: NL at 0.025 cents per kWh, Quebec at 0.9 cents per kWh (36 times higher), with NL leaving massive value on the table. The extremely low water cost at Churchill Falls combined with its 17% contribution to Quebec supply is the primary explanation for Quebec having the lowest electricity prices in Canada and the G7.

Water royalty terms under the MOU are likely to be modernized but specifics are unknown to the public. This could dramatically affect the economics of proposed projects, and critical information about alternative project costs is not publicly available. Hydro-Quebec operates in a monopsony position as a single buyer, can suppress prices through cost-minimization, and uses a rent-dissipation strategy that benefits Quebec via equalization payments. Dr. May requested key cost information from NL Hydro in February and is still waiting for a response months later, making independent analysis impossible.

KEY STATISTICS

Current royalties: NL water royalty to CF(L)Co at 0.025 cents per kWh, Quebec water royalty to HQ at 0.9 cents per kWh, with a 36 times disparity. CF(L)Co 2024 expenses: total expenses $113.963 million, water royalties $8.79 million (7.7% of expenses), salaries and benefits over $43 million, maintenance $12.7 million. Potential revenue scenarios: current NL royalty revenue approximately $8.79 million per year, if Quebec rate applied $310.5 million per year, representing a 35 times increase. Production assumptions: Churchill Falls annual generation 34,500 MWh with 90% going to Quebec.

ECONOMIC CONCEPTS: Monopsony is a market with a single buyer (Hydro-Quebec) having price-setting power, the opposite of monopoly, which suppresses prices below competitive levels. Rent dissipation is an economic strategy to reduce apparent profits, keeping revenues low to appear poorer and maximize federal equalization payments. Differential rents are resource rents based on productivity differences capturing value above the lowest-cost alternative. Scarcity rents reflect the opportunity cost of using a scarce resource and change with market conditions.
