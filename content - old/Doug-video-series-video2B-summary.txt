Purpose: Concise version for fast voice responses - Doug May's perspective

DOUG'S MAIN ARGUMENT (VIDEO 2B):

Churchill Falls is the most productive single source of electricity for Hydro-Québec, providing 17% of Quebec's total electricity at by far the lowest cost (~0.3¢/kWh vs 5-7¢/kWh for other sources). Its importance is growing as drought reduces Quebec's own generation, making the MOU's proposed 3,900 MW of new capacity increasingly critical.

KEY POINTS FROM DOUG'S ANALYSIS:

CHURCHILL FALLS vs ROBERT-BOURASSA:

Rated Capacity:
• Churchill Falls: 5,428 MW/hour
• Robert-Bourassa: 5,616 MW/hour (higher rated capacity)

Actual 2024 Generation:
• Churchill Falls: ~34,500 MW
• Robert-Bourassa: ~30,000 MW (lower despite higher capacity)
• CF to Quebec: ~31,000 MW (90% of output)
• **Churchill Falls STILL most productive single source for HQ**

CHURCHILL FALLS COST STRUCTURE:

Cost Analysis (Doug's calculation using NL Hydro data):
• Cost: $2.95 per megawatt-hour
• Equivalent: 0.295 cents per kilowatt-hour
• About 0.3¢/kWh (approximately)

The Revenue Puzzle Explained:
• Base contract: 0.2¢/kWh (often cited)
• Guaranteed winter availability premium: Adds revenue
• Special arrangements: NL Hydro gives up power, HQ pays premium
• **Actual average revenue: ~5.9¢/kWh**
• This explains profitability: Revenue (5.9¢) > Costs (0.3¢)

Cost Comparison:
• Churchill Falls: 0.3¢/kWh
• Robert-Bourassa: 5-7¢/kWh (some sources)
• Doug's note: "That seems extremely high to me" - "too much of a difference"
• Invites HQ to comment if incorrect

THE 34.2% OWNERSHIP FACTOR:

CF(L)Co Ownership:
• Hydro-Québec: 34.2%
• NL Hydro: 65.8%

HQ's Perspective:
• Likely considers CF(L)Co "part of its Quebec operations"
• Views Churchill Falls as integral to hydro generating capacity
• Historical context: 1927 Labrador boundary dispute
• Quebec believed Churchill River basin was part of Quebec
• British Privy Council ruled differently (awarded to Newfoundland)
• **This historical claim still figures in Quebec's perception**

Operational Impact:
• HQ forces CF(L)Co to be cost minimizer
• Churchill Falls produces extremely low-cost electricity
• Helps explain why Montreal has lowest prices in Canada and G7

QUEBEC'S INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY:

Aluminum Industry Example:
• 7 of 8 aluminum smelters in Canada located in Quebec
• Cheap electricity critical for aluminum smelting
• Churchill Falls helps explain location choice
• Part of Quebec's deliberate industrial strategy

WHY MONTREAL ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE SO LOW - THREE KEY FACTORS:

1. Most Productive Station:
• Churchill Falls = most productive in HQ system (as Quebec sees it)
• Provides ~17% of total electricity available to Quebec
• Does so at lowest cost available - BY FAR

2. Effective Price Consideration:
• Even if price HQ pays CF(L)Co increases
• Effective price only increases by 65.8% (NL's share)
• Why? HQ is paying itself for its 34.2% share
• Doug's criticism: Other analyses don't emphasize this enough

3. Growing Relative Importance:
• Importance growing as drought reduces Quebec's generation
• Will continue growing as demand increases
• Free market prices increasing (AI, EVs, population)
• Makes Churchill Falls' fixed-price power more valuable

PROPOSED NEW CAPACITY (3,900 MW TOTAL):

1. Gull Island (NEW - Most Significant):
• Capacity: 2,250 MW/hour
• Completely new facility

2. Churchill Falls Expansion:
• Two new turbines
• Capacity: 1,100 MW/hour

3. Churchill Falls Upgrade:
• Upgrade existing turbines
• Capacity: 550 MW/hour

Associated Infrastructure:
• New transmission lines from Gull Island to grid
• Paid for by NL Hydro

CRITICAL INFORMATION GAPS (Doug's Concerns):

What We DON'T Know:
1. **Expected Annual Generation** - have capacity, not generation projections
2. **Prices for Each Project** - unknown pricing structure
3. **Dynamic vs Fixed Pricing** - HQ promoting dynamic pricing but MOU discussions focus on fixed
4. **Cost Timing** - have totals but not when costs occur

Doug's Conclusion:
• "Capital budgeting, your cost benefit analysis cannot be applied. Full stop."
• Translation: "Sound decision analysis is not available"
• Can only analyze based on available aggregate data

PREMIER LEGAULT'S POSITION:

Public Statement:
• Projects provide long-term, much-needed cheap power to HQ
• Benefits domestic customers
• Without projects: electricity prices would increase "much more"

Timeline Considerations:
• HQ and NL Hydro advocating "aggressive construction timeline"
• By commissioning: "quite a different world from the one we're living in now"
• Risk: "Any deficiencies in current agreement will be magnified 5-10 years from now"

DOUG'S KEY TAKEAWAYS:

Churchill Falls' Current Role:
• Most productive single source for HQ
• Provides 17% of Quebec's electricity
• Lowest cost by far (0.3¢/kWh vs 5-7¢/kWh)
• Growing importance due to drought

Ownership Dynamic:
• 34.2% self-ownership reduces impact of price increases
• Quebec views CF as integral to its own system
• Forces cost minimization at CF(L)Co

Future Importance:
• 3,900 MW essential for maintaining low Quebec prices
• Growing demand (AI, EVs, population) makes projects critical
• Rising free market prices increases value of fixed-price power

Analytical Gaps:
• Insufficient information for proper cost-benefit analysis
• Don't know generation expectations, project prices, cost timing
• Dynamic pricing reality not reflected in MOU discussions
• World will be different in 5-10 years - deficiencies will be magnified

TRANSITION TO VIDEO 3:
• Will examine HQ's export/import prices
• Doug calls it "very important video"
• Will show dynamic pricing in action and market price variations

KEY STATISTICS:
• CF rated capacity: 5,428 MW/hour
• Robert-Bourassa capacity: 5,616 MW/hour
• CF 2024 generation: ~34,500 MW
• Robert-Bourassa 2024: ~30,000 MW
• CF to Quebec: ~31,000 MW (90%)
• CF = 17% of Quebec's electricity
• CF cost: 0.295¢/kWh
• CF revenue: ~5.9¢/kWh
• Robert-Bourassa cost: 5-7¢/kWh
• HQ ownership: 34.2%
• New capacity total: 3,900 MW
• Canadian aluminum smelters in Quebec: 7 of 8
