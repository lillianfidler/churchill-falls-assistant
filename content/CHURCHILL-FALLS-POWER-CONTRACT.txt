may be made without reference to any assignee of this Power Contract as security.
4.2 Operation
4.2.1 Operational Flexibility
The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for Hydro-Quebec to have the benefit
operational flexibility of CFLCo's facilities in relation to the Hydro-Quebec system. Accordingly:
II
of
(i) Hydro-Quebec may request CFLCo to operate the Plant so as to supply Hydro-Quebec's
schedule of power requirements, provided that no such request shall be less than the Minimum
Capacity or, except as provided in Section 6.4, more than the Firm Capacity;
(ii) Hydro-Quebec may require deliveries which have the effect of varying the amount of
water to be carried in storage at any time, provided that, in so doing, sufficient water is left in
storage so that Minimum Capacity can always be maintained.
(ii) CFLCo agrees to make available to Hydro-Quebec information relating to the hydrology
of the drainage basin and the levels of the reservoirs and the measurement and metering of any
spillage from the reservoir; and to co-operate fully with Hydro-Quebec in the forecasting of energy
which can be made available.
4.2.2 Existing Obligations
Hydro-Quebec acknowledges and agrees that CFLCo has existing obligations to supply power and
energy in respect of the Twin Falls Power Corporation Limited loads referred to in Note 1 of Schedule
of the present Power Contract, that no provision hereof shall operate to hinder or prevent the fulfilment by CFLCo of its said obligations to Twin Falls Power Corporation Limited covering 225,000
kilowatts at 100% load factor and that the fulfilment of such obligation shall not constitute recapture
under Section 6.6.
4.2.3 Protection of Recapture

Should Hydro-Quebec notify CFLCo of any condition which may prevent delivery of Firm Capacity and energy, CFLCo shall, not later than 15 days after receipt of such notice, either (a) proceed diligently with the work of maintenance or repair called for by such notice and complete the
same with all reasonable despatch or (b) inform Hydro-Quebec that, for reasons which CFLCo shall
state, such work is not necessary to maintain said facilities serviceable in accordance with sound utility
practice and undertake that, if a penalty or penalties are incurred as a result of such work not being performed, then such penalty or penalties will apply at 110% of the amounts otherwise payable under
Article X. Moreover, Hydro-Quebec in such event shall retain all legal recourses otherwise available
to it for damages suffered in excess of the penalty or penalties.
4.2.5 Right of Hydro-Quebec to Operate
Should CFLCo, not being prevented by any event of Force Majeure, be unwilling at any time to
operate the Plant, and should the Plant then be operable, Hydro-Quebec, if not then in default here- under, shall have the right to cause the Plant to be operated for the account of CFLCo in accordance
with sound utility practice until CFLCo itself resumes such operation.
4.2.6 Spinning Reserve
Hydro-Quebec may request CFLCo from time to time to employ such unit or units as are then
available for such purpose to provide spinning reserve. In such case the amount of water required to.
so operate such unit or units, as calculated from the turbine rating and flow curves, will be considered
as Energy Payable on the same basis as if such water had been spilled, but after allowing for energy delivered from the unit or units on spinning reserve.
4.2.7 Орeration of Reservoir
Hydro-Quebec shall not request CFLCo to operate the Plant in such a manner as to imperil the
equipment or facilities thereof or so that the security of the reservoir structures is endangered, and

For the purpose of the present Power Contract the parties shall, by mutual agreement, establish,
revise and maintain up to date in the light of the experience gained in operating the Plant a detailed
operating manual covering all procedures of interrelated operations. The establishment, revision and maintaining up to date of the operating manual shall be the sole responsibility of the parties hereto
without reference to any assignee of this Power Contract as security.
4.2.9 Control of Frequency and Power
For the purpose of the present Power Contract Hydro-Quebec shall be responsible for regulating frequency and CFLCo shall be responsible for power and reactive flows in the transmission circuits
of the Plant, to meet the schedules to be provided by Hydro-Quebec pursuant hereto. Each party shall so operate its system as to minimize voltage and power swings transmitted to the system of the
other party.
4.3 Interruptions
(i) Either party may at any time, for the purpose of safeguarding human life or protecting from
major damage the storage, generating or transmission facilities of CFLCo or the Hydro-Quebec system,
discontinue or reduce, but only to the extent necessary, the supply or taking of power and energy hereunder.
9
Each party shall be prompt and diligent in removing the cause of any such discontinuance or
reduction and to this end shall maintain an adequate reserve of spare parts and apparatus.
The party on whose system the cause of an interruption shall have occurred shall inform the
other of such cause as soon as possible after the interruption has occurred and, when feasible, shall
state the estimated duration of such interruption. Any such information conveyed verbally shall be
confirmed in writing without delay.
(ii) If CFLCo should find it necessary or advisable to take out of service, for the purposes of
making repairs, renewals or replacements, two or more units or their associated equipment, HydroQuebec will cooperate in estimating, to the best of its knowledge, what might be the most suitable
time for CFLCo to do so in order to reduce or eliminate the penalty which CFLCo might incur for
failure to provide Firm Capacity. All such discontinuances and reductions in the supply of power and
energy, total or partial, shall be of minimum duration and, when possible, arranged for at a time least
objectionable to Hydro-Quebec.
4.4. Communications System
The parties shall establish and maintain such continuous and reliable communications between
their respective power systems as may be required for operation, protection, automatic computer
control, data transmission, telemetering and voice channels. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.1
hereof, the initial communications system shall have the characteristics contemplated by Schedule I.
CFLCo shall, at its sole expense, construct, own, operate and maintain that part of the communications system which is at the Plant or which is on the Plant side of the Delivery Point. Hydro-Quebec
shall, at its sole expense, construct, own, operate and maintain the remainder of said system.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.4, the specifications for the said communications system shall be those furnished by Hydro-Quebec and Hydro-Quebec shall have the right to
carry out the acceptance tests upon completion of the construction of such system.
4.5 Metering and Measurement
The parties shall establish and maintain adequate and reliable metering facilities to measure
power and energy and to give such other measurements as may be required by the parties. The
initial facilities so eştablished shall have the characteristics contemplated by Schedule I, subject to
possible revision pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.1.
The metering and measuring facilities of Hydro-Quebec shall, at its sole expense, be installed,
maintained and operated by Hydro-Quebec at the intermediate station on its system nearest the
Delivery Point and, subject to such adjustments as are required to reflect delivery at the Delivery
Point, shall be used for billing purposes. Hydro-Quebec shall communicate to CFLCo all information
on measurement from said facilities.
The metering and measuring facilities of CFLCo shall, at its sole expense, be installed, maintained
and operated by CFLCo at the Plant. Hydro-Quebec may from time to time, at its sole option and
expense, install, maintain and operate duplicates of all or any such facilities of CFLCo and CFLCo
shall furnish the space and access reasonably necessary for such purpose. Hydro-Quebec may at any
time, at its expense, remove, with or without replacement, all or any of such duplicate facilities.
All meters and measuring facilities, to be used or which may be used for billing, shall be periodically tested and such meters calibrated if necessary in accordance with agreed standards at least as
high as those established by the Department of Trade and Commerce of Canada. Each party shall
give adequate prior notice to the other of any test which it intends to conduct and the other may send
authorized representatives who shall be entitled to attend and witness the test. Any meter or other
measuring facility which fails to function or which functions incorrectly, shall be promptly adjusted,
10
repaired or replaced by a like facility having the required accuracy. Each party shall, promptly on
request from the other, test its metering and measuring facilities.
Should any meter or other measuring facility used for billing purposes break down or be found
not to have the required accuracy, CFLCo and Hydro-Quebec shall determine (from CFLCo's own
facilities and from such information as Hydro-Quebec may supply, and Hydro-Quebec shall be entitled
to do so) the amount of power and energy supplied during the period of failure or inaccuracy and the
duration of such period. In making such determinations the parties hereto shall rely on that data and
information available to them as aforesaid which the parties consider most conducive to as accurate
determination as the circumstances may permit.
4.6 Method of Calculating Spillage and Inventory
The number of kilowatthours equivalent at the Delivery Point to any volume of water shall
determined as follows:
(i) Spillway Gauges and Records
a
be
The spillway structures of the Plant shall be rated by tests, carried out under both summer
and winter conditions, which may be witnessed by representatives of Hydro-Quebec and shall be
equipped with gauges to record water levels and gate positions so as to provide a permanent
record from which shall be determined the volume of water spilled at any time.
(ii) Reservoir Levels and Records
The reservoirs shall be equipped with water level gauges to record water levels so as to provide a permanent record, and graphs satisfactory to Hydro-Quebec showing water storage in
relation to water level shall be prepared in order to permit the establishment of usable water
inventory for any reservoir level.
(iii) Basis of Determination
When converting spillage from the reservoirs or inventory of usable water in the reservoirs
to kilowatthours at the Delivery Point, the volume of water shall be determined from said records
in (i) and (ii) above and the number of kilowatthours equivalent at the Delivery Point to the
water volume shall be determined on the basis of 1,000 cubic feet of water representing 21 kilowatthours at the Delivery Point.
(iv) Review
The parties shall review the said basis of conversion of water volume to kilowatthours as
outlined in (ii) above on the first anniversary of the Effective Date so as to establish as precisely
as is practicable, under plant operating conditions as they actually exist, the conversion facto
which permits accurate calculation of the equivalent number of kilowatthours at the Delivery
Point. Either party shall have the right to request a further review at every four year interval
after the Effective Date.
ARTICLE V
COMPLETION GUARANTEE
5.1 Provisions for Additional Funds Required
Should CFLCo, after having obtained or having arranged to obtain from equity investments and
from Debt Obligations at least seven hundred million dollars in the aggregate in Canadian funds or
the equivalent in Canadian and U.S. funds for the costs of construction and bringing into operation
of the Plant, determine that it does not have available sufficient funds, which CFLCo is not
restricted by any provision of any Debt Obligation from using for the purpose, to complete the
Plant, to bring it into full operation and to provide for Debt Service Requirement and Expense
Charges in respect of the period prior to the Completion Date (additional funds so needed for such
purposes being herein referred to as "the additional funds required") then such additional funds
11
required shall be provided to CFLCo, in accordance with the provisions of this Article V, if, as and
to the extent from time to time requested by CFLCo.
of
to
of
The additional funds required shall be provided whenever required and, to the extent and within
the jurisdictions where it is legally possible to do so, shall be provided by offering at a price
$1,000 per unit to all the shareholders of CFLCo who hold at least 5% of its outstanding common
shares pro rata to their then respective holdings of such common shares of CFLCo in relation
the aggregate of their said holdings (provided that they shall have previously subscribed and paid for
in full, if and when ofered to them, all the Units comprising General Mortgage Bonds and shares of
CFLCo to which they were then entitled) said units each consisting of $1,000 principal amount
Debentures of CFLCo and 10 fully paid and non-assessable no par value common shares of CFLCo.
CFLCo shall promptly take all action within its power to satisfy all legal requirements necessary to
permit each such offering to be made. The shareholders to whom the units are offered shall have
days to subseribe and pay for the said units and Hydro-Quebec shall always subscribe and pay for its
pro rata share of the offering. Failing full subscription and payment by the other offerees CFLCO
shall give Hydro-Quebec notice of the amount of units which have not been subscribed and paid for
and Hydro-Quebec shall be bound to take, or in any event to pay for, within the next 60 days, all units
not subscribed and paid for by the other offerees. Any units for which Hydro-Quebec has made payment before delivery shall be delivered to Hydro-Quebec with all despatch as soon as legally possible.
If for any reason, CFLCo shall be prevented from making the offering available in whole or in part
to Hydro-Quebec, Hydro-Quebec shall nevertheless be bound to provide the additional funds required
whenever required and after giving effect to subseriptions and payments under offers, if any, which it
was legally possible to make.
30
Should CFLCo have previously elected not to offer to its shareholders other than Hydro-Quebec
units comprising General Mortgage Bonds and shares of CFLCo then the shareholders of CFLCO
other than Hydro-Quebec shall have no right to subscribe for units as provided for in the present Section 5.1 and in such event Hydro-Quebec alone shall provide the additional funds required under the
present Section 5.1 whenever required and, to the extent where it is legally possible to do so, shall
receive the units provided for in the present Section 5.1 and CFLCo shall in each case promptly take
all action within its power to satisfy all legal requirements necessary to allow it to deliver to HydroQuebec units as afore-described.
In order to keep Hydro-Quebec advised of CFLCo's expenditures and requirements for funds,
CFLCo shall henceforth furnish to Hydro-Quebec periodically, not less often than once every three months, a statement showing source and application of funds to the date of such report and as
projected to the Completion Date.
Unless it becomes evident that construction delays will prevent or have prevented full intended availability of capacity and energy by the relevant Delivery Dates, CFLCo undertakes that it will
not require Hydro-Quebec under the provisions of this Section 5.1:
(a) to purchase more than $75 million of units in any twelve month period,
(b) to purchase any units prior to January 1, 1971,
(c) to purchase units in excess of $100 million prior to June 30, 1972, or
(d) to purchase units in excess of $200 million prior to June 30, 1974.
5.2 General Provisions applicable to Debentures
The Debentures to be offered as aforesaid, as part of units, shall without limitation.
(a) be issued under an Indenture in form and content satisfactory to Hydro-Quebec, who shall have the choice of the Trustee for the Debentureholders, said Indenture also to be satis- factory to counsel for the purchasers of the First Mortgage Bonds;
12
(b) be fully subordinated to both the First Mortgage Bonds and General Mortgage Bonds
of CFLCo, referred to in Section 5.4, and to the bank loans of CFLCo incurred prior to the
Completion Date and shall be unsecured;
(c) bear interest at Hydro-Quebec's last borrowing cost, taking into account premium
or discount, if any, and commissions payable by Hydro-Quebec, at the time of issue of the unit
of which they shall form part, such interest to be a priority call on CFLCo's monies otherwise
available for dividends;
(d) be entitled to a sinking fund commencing one year after the commencement of the
sinking fund on the General Mortgage Bonds, of 2% of the amount of Debentures outstanding
at the commencement of each year, such sinking fund to be a call on said monies available for
dividends second only to interest;
(e) provide that CFLCo's interest and sinking fund obligations on the Debentures will be
subject to availability of said monies available for dividends, no default occurring if payments
must be deferred because of non-availability of funds;
(f) provide that no dividend may be declared on any shares of CFLCo unless and until
all past sinking fund and interest payments on the Debentures shall have been paid or set aside
or otherwise provided for;
(g) except when otherwise required and agreed in respect of any Debt Service Requirement
resulting from the refinancing of any Debt Obligation under the provisions of Article XI hereof,
mature two years after the maturity of the General Mortgage Bonds;
to
(h) be redeemable at CFLCo's option at par and accrued interest or, if this involves loss
Hydro-Quebec because of its own borrowings to cover being non-call or delayed call, at
premium sufficient to prevent such loss;
(i) not be entitled to exercise any remedies under the Debentures or under the Indenture
or Trust Deed creating the Debentures while the First Mortgage Bonds are outstanding.
5.3 Dividend Restrictions
So long as any loan by Hydro-Quebec pursuant to Section 5.1 remains outstanding Hydro-Quebec
shall be entitled to require CFLCo to undertake that until the earlier of the Completion Date or that
date upon which Hydro-Quebec ceases to be a lender of the additional funds required as aforesaid
no dividend shall be declared or paid by CFLCo on its shares.
Subsequent to the Completion Date the dividend restrictions set forth in the Indenture relating
to Debentures issued pursuant to Section 5.1 shall apply, subject to any dividend restrictions in the
Trust Deeds covering the First Mortgage and General Mortgage Bonds of CFLCo.
5.4 Right of Hydro-Quebec to cure events of default under certain Debt Obligations of CFLCO
It is contemplated that CFLCo's principal sources of borrowed funds for the Project will be its
First Mortgage Bonds issued under a Trust Deed, its General Mortgage Bonds issued under a Trust Deed, its Debentures issued under an Indenture as provided in the present Article V and bank loans
made under loan agreements with banks.
Each such Trust Deed, Indenture or bank loan agreement shall provide that:
(a) the trustee or trustees thereunder or the bank, as the case may be, shall give notice
to Hydro-Quebec at the same time as it gives such notice to CFLCo of the occurrence of an
event of default or of a default under such instrument which with notice or lapse of time would
become an event of default under such instrument;
(b) Hydro-Quebec shall have the same rights as CFLCo, which rights shall be exercisable
within the same period of time as may be afforded CFLCo by such instrument, to cure any such default or any event of default;
(c) the cure by Hydro-Quebec of any such default or event of default or action taken by Hydro-Quebec to cure such a default or event of default shall have the same effect, under such
13
instrument, insofar as such cure or action relates to suspending, waiving or terminating any rights or remedies exercisable by the trustee, trustees or bank in consequence of the occurrence of such default or event of default as would such cure or action if effected or taken at the same
time by CFLCo; and
(d) such trustee, trustees or bank, as the case may be, shall give both Hydro-Quebec and
CFLCo the prior written notice specified in any such instrument prior to exercising his rights accelerate maturity or take possession of the Plant. to
Hydro-Quebec may immediately on receipt of such notice exercise its right to cure default or events of default under any such Trust Deed, Indenture or bank loan agreement except in circum- stances where CFLCo is able promptly (not later than midway through the period of time referred
to in (b) of the preceding paragraph) to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Hydro-Quebec that such default or event of default either (i) arose from inadvertence or error and can be, and is being, cured by CFLCo or (ii) is merely technical and CFLCo can obtain, and is obtaining, a waiver of the same.
Hydro-Quebec shall, except where the event of default arose as a result of Hydro-Quebec's failure to perform any of its obligations hereunder, have the option to cure any event of default under any such Trust Deed, Indenture or bank loan agreement and if Hydro-Quebec elects to do so it shall be entitled to take any and all action required to effect such cure in its own name or the name of CFLCo.
of
In such case, CFLCo shall cooperate fully with Hydro-Quebec and shall carry out all reasonable
instructions of Hydro-Quebec within the power of CFLCo and related to the curing of such event default. In effecting any such cure Hydro-Quebec shall not take any action or instruct CFLCo to take
any action which would violate any binding obligations of CFLCo to others. Any amounts paid expended by Hydro-Quebec in effecting such cure shall be deemed to be advances to CFLCO within
the meaning of Section 5.1 entitling Hydro-Quebec to receive 10 common shares of CFLCo with every $1000 principal amount of Debentures.
or
In order to secure its rights under the Trust Deed covering the First Mortgage Bonds of CFLCo, Hydro-Quebec shall be an Intervenant to the said Deed.

Hydro-Quebec, in purchasing power and energy hereunder, shall have no obligation to purchase, prior to the Effective Date, during any stage of construction, energy in excess of that contemplated by Column 6 of Schedule II as intended to be then available.
6.3 Prior to Effective Date
Column 1 of Schedule II sets forth the Delivery Dates and Column 6 of Schedule II sets forth the
amounts of energy to be available on such Delivery Dates for the period prior to the Effective Date.
14
By mutual agreement such Delivery Dates may be advanced, in which event said Schedule II shall be
deemed to have been revised to conform.
6.4 Firm Capacity
The Firm Capacity shall be available at all times when Hydro-Quebec has requested it. In addition whenever additional capacity can, in the opinion of CFLCo, be made available, such capacity
shall also be available to Hydro-Quebec on request.
In the event of a Deficiency occurring in the making available by CFLCo of capacity, the pro- visions of Article X hereof shall apply.
Subject to the provisions of Sections 4.3 and 6.7 hereof, at no time after the sixth Delivery Date
shall the power taken by Hydro-Quebec be less than Minimum Capacity.
6.5 Firm Capacity Schedules
At least seven days in advance of the first Delivery Date and at weekly intervals thereafter Hydro- Quebec shall furnish to CFLCo:
(a) an hourly schedule of its proposed capacity requirements over the week following, and (b) an estimate of what Hydro-Quebec is likely to schedule over the three weeks thereafter.
Each such seven day schedule shall constitute Hydro-Quebec's request for availability of such capacity
over the period scheduled to the various extents and at the various times indicated by the schedule,
but subject to Hydro-Quebec's right to make further requests for changes in capacity during the period within the limits of Firm Capacity and Minimum Capacity. Any such request shall be con- sidered as revising the schedule to the required extent and for the required time.
6.6 Recapture
CFLCo may, on not less than three years prior written notice to Hydro-Quebec, elect to withhold
from the power and energy agreed to be sold hereunder blocks at a specified load factor per month,
to be stated in said notice, of not less than 60% nor more than 90%, which blocks in the aggregate
shall not exceed during the term hereof 300,000 kilowatts for a maximum withholding of 2.362 billion kilowatthours per year provided that:
(i) energy so withheld is sold by CFLCo only for consumption outside the Province Quebec; of
(ii) any part of the energy so withheld which, from time to time may become available for
purchase by Hydro-Quebec, may be purchased by Hydro-Quebec, if before the Effective Date, as
part of Energy Payable priced in accordance with Section 8.3, and, if on or after the Effective Date, at the price of 33.33% of the Applicable Rate multiplied by the number of kilowatthours so
purchased, and to this end Hydro-Quebec shall have access to the pertinent sales records of CFLCo; and
(iii) any part of the pewer and energy so withheld before the seventh Delivery Date shall
not relieve CFLCo from its commitment to deliver power and energy in accordance with Schedule
II of the present Power Contract.
6.7 Recapture Adjustments
Immediately upon any recapture becoming effective, the Annual Energy Base shall be reduced by the same amount of kilowatthours per year as are recaptured and Firm Capacity and Minimum
Capacity shall be reduced by the same amount of kilowatts as are recaptured. Should such recapture
occur prior to the seventh Delivery Date, Schedule II shall not be revised. Should such recapture
occur on or after the seventh Delivery Date, Schedule II shall be revised accordingly.
15
7.1 Delivery Point
ARTICLE VII
DELIVERY
The Delivery Point shail at all times and notwithstanding any other provisions of this Power
Contract be at such point on the transmission circuits as will enable CFLCo to sell the energy
generated by the Plant without forfeiting any direct or indirect tax benefits or rebates now available
to CFLCo. Any facilities of the Plant which may at any time be found to be located on the Quebec
side of the Delivery Point shall be and are hereby acknowledged always to have been the property of,
and to have been purchased for the account of, Hydro-Quebec. Subject always as aforesaid, and to
any further adjustments which may be made by mutual consent, the Delivery Point for each circuit
shall be at the height of land, about opposite present Mile 148.8 on the Quebec North Shore and
Labrador Railway, which is the presumed watershed between the St. Lawrence River and the
Churchill River.
7.2 Transmission Facilities
The construction, operation and maintenance of the necessary transmission facilities up to the
Delivery Point will be the exclusive responsibility of, and at the sole cost of, CFLCo and onwards
from the Delivery Point will be the exclusive responsibility of, and at the sole cost of, Hydro-Quebec.
8.1 Base Rate
ARTICLE VIII
RATE AND PRICE
The Base Rate shall be, after the Effective Date:
for the frst 5 years, 2.7734 mills per kilowatthour;
thereafter for the next 5 years, 2.7110 mills per kilowatthour;
thereafter for the next 5 years, 2.6591 mills per kilowatthour;
thereafter for the next 10 years, 2.5449 mills per kilowatthour; and
thereafter 2.3787 mills per kilowatthour.
8.2 Applicable Rates
The Base Rate shall be subject to adjustment as follows:
If the Final Capital Cost of the Plant is less than $728,000,000 each Base Rate shall be
reduced by one-half of the same fraction thereof as is, of $723,000,000, the diference between
$728,000,000 and the Final Capital Cost of the Plant.
If the Final Capital Cost of the Plant is more than $791,000,000 each Base Rate shall be
increased by one-half of the same fraction thereof as is, of $791,000,000, the difference between
$791,000,000 and the lesser of the Final Capital Cost of the Plant or $900,000,000.
For the purpose of any such adjustment, CFLCo shall furnish to Hydro-Quebec, not later
than the frst Delivery Date hereunder CFLCo's reasonable estimate of what the Final Capital
Cost of the Plant is likely to be and such estimate shall be the basis of adjustment until full
determination of the Final Capital Cost of the Plant whereupon the Applicable Rates shall be
recalculated as a final adjustment under this Section 8.2. Any overpayment or underpayment resulting from a difference between the Applicable Rates based on such estimate and the
Applicabie Rates based on the Final Capital Cost of the Plant shall be promptly provided for
16
with interest to the date of adjustment at 7% per annum by, as the case may be, a refund by
CFLCo to Hydro-Quebec or a supplementary payment by Hydro-Quebec to CFLCo.
8.3 Price Prior to Effective Date
After the first Delivery Date and prior to the Effective Date, the monthly price for Energy
Payable shall be:
(i) for that portion of the amount of energy indicated in Column 6 of Schedule II which,
whether or not taken, CFLCo makes available to Hydro-Quebec:
plus
2.8253 mills per kilowatthour for 90% of such energy made available, and
1.0000 mill per kilowatthour for the remaining 10% of such energy made available,
(ii) for energy CFLCo may be willing to supply in excess of the amount indicated in
Column 6 of Schedule II:
0.5000 mill per kilowatthour for that portion of such energy which is taken by Hydro-Quebec.
The aforesaid rates of 2.8253 mills per kilowatthour and 1.0000 mill per kilowatthour are subject to
adjustment under the provisions of Section 8.2, but such adjustments will only apply to amounts of
energy made available by CFLCo up to the amounts indicated by Column 7 of Schedule II, which
Column 7 amounts shall be considered to include firstly that energy made available which is payable
at the 2.8253 rate.
In reckoning the amount of energy shown in Schedule II to be available in any month adjustment shall be made to reconcile the actual number of hours in the month with the fact that said
Schedule has been prepared on the basis of a 730 hour month.
Payments for power and energy made by Hydro-Quebec to CFLCo prior to the Effective Date
shall be used by CFLCo towards satisfaction of current payments to be made by CFLCo on account
of Final Capital Cost of the Plant, Expense Charges and Debt Service Requirement and maintenance
of such working capital or other similar requirements as may be stipulated in any outstanding Debt Obligation.
8.4 Price After the Effective Date
After the Effective Date the monthly price for power and energy shall be:
(i) the product of the Basic Contract Demand multiplied by 66.67% of the Applicable Rate
(earned whether or not taken or made available), plus
(ii) the product of Energy Payable as calculated for the month then ended multiplied by
33.33% of the Applicable Rate.
Such price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 8.5.
8.5 Direct Price Adjustments
Direct adjustments of the price payable by Hydro-Quebec for energy hereunder shall be made
the circumstances following:
8.5.1-Recapture Notice Period
in
During any notice period prior to the recaptures contemplated by Section 6.6 hereof the
price for Energy Payable, each month after the first Delivery Date, by Hydro-Quebec to CFLCo
shall be reduced by 0.27 mill per kilowatthour for 1/12 of the number of kilowatthours per year
in respect of which a Recapture Notice has been given.
17
8.5.2-Resulting from Variations between Annual Energy Base and the annual average Energy Payable
(i) Any difference, in the period between the Effective Date and the eighth anniversary
thereof or in any four-year period thereafter ending on an anniversary of the Effective Date,
between the annual average of the total of all Energy Payable during such period ("the annual average") and the Annual Energy Base in effect during such period, shall be adjusted by a refund
from CFLCo to Hydro-Quebec if the annual average is less than the Annual Energy Base or by
a supplementary payment from Hydro-Quebec to CFLCo if the annual average exceeds the
Annual Energy Base, provided that there shall be excluded from the calculation that part of such
annual average which exceeds the amount obtained when the total amount of all recaptures of
energy is deducted from 32.2 billion killowatthours.
(ii) Such payment shall be computed by:
(a) adding the total of all Energy Payable during the period,
(b) dividing (a) by the number of years in the period and making any exclusion required under (i) above,
(c) establishing the difference between (b) and the Annual Energy Base in effect during
the period,
(d) multiplying (c) by 66.67% of the Applicable Rate or Rates in the period as
separate computation for each year,
a
(e) the amount of the adjustment will then be the sum of the yearly products from
(d) plus the net amount of any interest provided for in (iii) following.
(iii) For interest calculation purposes, the difference, if any, between the Annual Energy
Base and the total Energy Payable for such year, in each of the years of the period for which
adjustment is made, shall be separately calculated. Each such annual difference shall be multi- plied by 66.67% of the Applicable Rate or Rates in effect for such year and interest shall accrue
thereon at 7% per annum from the commencement of such year to the end of the eight-year or
four-year period concerned, at which time the interest accrued shall, by addition or subtraction or
both, be consolidated into, and form part of, the adjustment payment to be made.
(iv) Any adjustment payment in respect of the first eight year period shall be made in
equal monthly instalments payable over the next eight years concurrently with the monthly
payments contemplated by Article XVI hereof, and any adjusting payment in respect of any
subsequent four-year period shall be made in equal monthly instalments payable over the next
four years concurrently with said monthly payments; provided that at the end of the term hereof
any such payment shall be made in one lump sum payable within three months of such end of
term and provided also that if the aggregate amount to be paid on any one adjustment is less
than $1,000,000 it shall be paid forthwith.
(v) Any such adjustment payment shall itself bear interest at 7% per annum from the date
adjustment is calculated and such interest shall be payable concurrently with each instalment
lump sum payment aforesaid.
or
9.1 Adjustment Intervals
ARTICLE IX
ADJUSTMENT OF ANNUAL ENERGY BASE
The number of kilowatthours per year comprising the Annual Energy Base may be adjusted during
the term hereof as of the eighth anniversary of the Effective Date, and thereafter as of the end of each
subsequent four year period.
18
9.2 Basis for Adjustment
If an adjustment takes place, the Annual Energy Base previously in effect shall be increased or
decreased, subject to the provisions of Section 9.3, in accordance with the difference between (a) the
Annual Energy Base previously in effect and (b) the total of the following divided by the number
of years since the Effective Date:
(i) the actual energy deliveries measured in kilowatthours taken by Hydro-Quebec at the
Delivery Point since the Effective Date, plus
(ii) the equivalent kilowatthours of any water spilled since the Effective Date, and
(iii) if the reservoir level is higher than it was at the Effective Date adding the equivalent
number of kilowatthours represented by the change in reservoir level as compared to the reservoir
level at the Effective Date, or
(iv) if the reservoir level is lower than it was at the Effective Date subtracting the equivalent
number of kilowatthours represented by the change in reservoir level as compared to the reservoir
level at the Effective Date.
9.3 Limitations on Adjustment of Annual Energy Base
(i) No adjustment of the Annual Energy Base at the end of any eight year or four year period
shall alter the then existing Annual Energy Base by more than 3/½% thereof.
(ii) No adjustment or adjustments of the Annual Energy Base shall ever cause it to exceed the
amount obtained when the amount of all recaptures of energy is deducted from 32.2 billion kilowatthours per annum.
9.4 Conditions under which Annual Energy Base may be Adjusted
(i) Either party without the consent of the other party being required may require a change
the Annual Energy Base of up to 31/½% provided
in
(a) the revised Annual Energy Base is equal to the cumulative experience from the Effective
Date to the adjustment date calculated as outlined in Section 9.2, or
(b) if the said cumulative experience differs from the Annual Energy Base by more than
3½% of the latter, the adjustment results in a revised Annual Energy Base which is different by
3/½% from the existing Annual Energy Base and is closer to the said cumulative experience than
said existing Annual Energy Base.
(ii) Without reference to the said cumulative experience, the parties may agree to any adjustment
in the Annual Energy Base which does not alter the existing Annual Energy Base by more than
313% thereof.

10.1 Extent of Penalty
ARTICLE X
FIRM CAPACITY PENALTY
Should a Deficiency occur, then CFLCo shall be subject to the applicable penalty outlined below,
which penalty Hydro-Quebec shall be entitled, subject as hereinafter provided in Article XVI, to
deduct from the payments next to be made by it to CFLCo hereunder:
(i) when the Deficiency Period is more than 30 minutes and not more than 4 hours there
shall be a penalty of $10 per megawatt for the maximum megawatts of such Deficiency lasting
continuously for 30 minutes, calculated to the nearest full megawatt;
(ii) when the Deficiency Period is more than 4 hours and not more than 10 hours there shall
be a penalty of $20 per megawatt for the maximum megawatts of such Deficiency lasting continuously for 30 minutes, calculated to the nearest full megawatt;
(iii) when the Deficiency Period is, or is deemed to be, 24 hours or more there shall be a
penalty of $40 per megawatt day for the maximum megawatts of such Deficiency lasting continuously for 30 minutes, calculated to the nearest full megawatt.
10.2 Rules Applicable
For the purpose of computing penalties as aforesaid:
10.2.1- any Deficiency Period in excess of 10 continuous hours and not exceeding 24 con- tinuous hours will be considered as a full 24 hours;
10.2.2 separate Deficiency Periods each lasting more than 30 minutes within a 24 hour time
span shall never result in a penalty greater than that which would have resulted if the maximum
of the Deficiencies had lasted for the full 24 hour period; and
10.2.3- if a Deficiency Period lasts for more than twenty-four hours, it may be divided into
any such four hour, ten hour and twenty-four hour periods as CFLCo may designate which would
cover the total Deficiency Period and separate penalties for each period so designated shall be determined as in Section 10.1.
10.3 No Penalty
There shall be no penalty applicable:
10.3.1- to any Deficiency which is less than one per cent of the capacity at the time requested by Hydro-Quebec;
10.3.2- to any part of any Deficiency which is due to Excessive Corona Losses;
10.3.3-during any period when CFLCo is unable to provide service due to disturbances
on the Hydro-Quebec system, such period to include not only the duration of the disturbance but
also the time required by CFLCo to restore service;
10.3.4- in any month in respect of which an advance was made to CFLCo by Hydro-Quebec
pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof;
10.3.5- during the period of, and to the extent of, the Deficiency resulting from any interruption for the safeguarding of human life permitted by paragraph (i) of Section 4.3 hereof;
10.3.6- to any Deficiency for which Hydro-Quebec is able to substitute capacity from its
own system, without using its reserve capacity and without impairing the reliability of service from
its system, at, in its sole judgment, no material increase in Hydro-Quebec's costs of operation; and
20
10.3.7- to any Deficiency resulting from a lack of water other than by reason of the failure
of impounding structures on any section of the reservoirs.
11.1 Prior Approval
ARTICLE XI
REFINANCINGS
Refinancings of CFLCo's Debt Obligations and revisions of existing Debt Obligation agreements
to permit the same shall be subject to the prior approval of both parties hereto.
11.2 Costs and Benefits
All costs and any benefits of any refinancing of any of CFLCo's Debt Obligations in respect of
which Hydro-Quebec had been making interest charge payments under Article XV shall be shared
equally by the parties hereto.
ARTICLE XII
DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENT AND EXPENSE CHARGES
12.1 Advances by Hydro-Quebec
If, in respect of any month during the period contemplated by Section 12.3 hereof, CFLCo will
be required to make any payment on account of Debt Service Requirement or in respect of Expense
Charges and CFLCo determines that, taking into account any restrictions to which CFLCo may be
subject regarding the employment of its funds, CFLCo will lack sufficient unrestricted funds to enable
it to make when due the required payment, CFLCo shall give at least 15 days prior notice of the
anticipated shortage to Hydro-Quebec, whereupon Hydro-Quebec shall advance to CFLCo in respect
of that month the full amount of the shortage in time to permit such payment to be made at due
date and CFLCo shall make such payment accordingly. If any Expense Charges, whether or not
of a capital nature, are non-recurring expenditures, Hydro-Quebec shall advance the sums required
at the times required upon notice from CFLCo as aforesaid.
12.2 Consideration for Advances
Hydro-Quebec shall receive from CFLCo, for each advance made to CFLCo by Hydro-Quebec
under this Article XII, units comprising unsecured subordinated Debentures, having the attributes
referred to in Article V hereof, and common shares of CFLCo. Save as otherwise provided in Section 12.4 and in the following paragraph, for each $1000 advanced by Hydro-Quebec it shall receive
one Debenture in the principal amount of $1,000 and five fully paid and non-assessable common
shares of CFLCo.
Such units shall not include common shares if and to the extent that the requirement for such
advances has resulted from a decrease in the revenue of CFLCo as the result of Hydro-Quebec having
taken during the three months immediately previous to the time such advance takes place less than
the amount obtained when one-fourth of all recaptures is deducted from 7.1 billion kilowatthours,
provided such reduced taking is not caused by Plant deficiencies.
If, for any reason CFLCo shall be prevented from making the aforesaid Debentures and shares
available in whole or in part to Hydro-Quebec, Hydro-Quebec shall nevertheless be bound to make the
advances required under this Article XII whenever required.
12.3 Duration of Obligation to Make Advances
Hydro-Quebec's obligation to make advances to CFLCo pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof shall
commence on the Completion Date and continue during the term of this Power Contract for so long
as any Debt Service Requirement exists.
21
12.4 Advances during Restoration
If the Plant becomes so damaged or destroyed as to render it inoperative CFLCo shall proceed
diligently with the work of restoration and resumption of operations, it being acknowledged by the
parties hereto that such is the desirable course to follow in the circumstances, and Hydro-Quebec
shall continue to make advances under Section 12.1, if, as, and to such extent as, may be required.
However, advances then made by Hydro-Quebec, in any circumstance contemplated by the next
paragraph of this Section, for Expense Charges related to such restoration and resumption of operations shall entitle Hydro-Quebec to receive 10 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures instead
of the 5 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures contemplated by Section 12.2.
If the Plant is so damaged as to reduce its Firm Capacity by at least 40% for a continuous period
of 6 months or more any advances by Hydro-Quebec for Expense Charges related to restoration and
resumption of operations shall be deemed advances for the purposes of this Section 12.4.
12.5 Estimate
Should CFLCo at any time call upon Hydro-Quebec for an advance under this Article XII, CFLCo
shall furnish to Hydro-Quebec for the latter's guidance CFLCo's estimate of the amounts and due
dates of all Debt Service Requirement and Expense Charges of CFLCo known to it which will become
payable in the next twelve months and CFLCo's estimate of the unrestricted funds expected to be
available to it at the times payments thereof will fall due.
12.6 Insurance Proceeds
Any proceeds of insurance which CFLCo may have on hand at the time any advance from HydroQuebec under Sections 12.1 and 12.4 hereof is required shall, to the extent CFLCo has the unrestricted
disposition thereof, free from other commitments, be considered as part of CFLCo's unrestricted funds
to be applied against the payment of CFLCo's Debt Service Requirement and Expense Charges.
13.1 Audit by Hydro-Quebec
ARTICLE XIII
ACCESS TO RECORDS
The Final Capital Cost of the Plant and any other item affecting payments to be made by HydroQuebec shall be subject to verification and audit by Hydro-Quebec which, for such purpose, shall at
all reasonable times have free access to the construction site and to the books, records and other documents relating to the costs, the Schedules and other pertinent data in the possession of CFLCo in
connection with the proposed power development. CFLCo shall make available to Hydro-Quebec, as
they are available, regular reports and other relevant information respecting the cost of the Plant, the
progress of construction, and all items affecting payments to be made by Hydro-Quebec or which
Hydro-Quebec may reasonably require for the purposes of this section.
13.2 Questions Arising
Any question which may arise as to the status, under the provisions of this Power Contract, of
any item affecting payments to be made by Hydro-Quebec, shall be jointly discussed by Hydro-Quebec
and CFLCo and, failing resolution by them, shall be referred to the independent auditors of CLFCo
for interpretation. Should Hydro-Quebec or CLFCo be unwilling to accept the interpretation of the
independent auditors of CFLCo on any such question, joint reference shall be made by Hydro-Quebec
and CFLCo to an independent auditor acceptable to each but whom neither otherwise employs,
retains or consults and shall be subject to determination by said independent auditor in accordance
with the applicable provisions of this Power Contract. Should Hydro-Quebec and CLFCo be unable
to agree on the appointment of such an independent auditor, they shall jointly request the President of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Quebec to make the appointment on their behalf and shall
22
then refer the question to the independent auditor so appointed. Such decisions shall always remain
subject to review by the Courts of competent jurisdiction.
13.3 Sharing of Expenses
The fees and expenses of any independent auditor, other than the independent auditors of CFLCo,
referred to in Section 13.2 and, if applicable, of the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Quebec shall be borme equally by Hydro-Quebec and CFLCo.
13.4 Annual Review
At the time of each annual audit of the affairs of CFLCo, all such items then known with respect
to Effective Interest Rates, Final Capital Cost of the Plant, Debt Service Requirement, Expense
Charges and U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange transactions and any other items affecting payments
to be made by Hydro-Quebec shall be referred to Hydro-Quebec for concurrence. All agreement of
such items by Hydro-Quebec shall be final and binding.
14.1 Variations in Exchange Rate
ARTICLE XIV
U.S. DOLLAR TRANSACTIONS
In the event of any difference between (i) the Weighted Average Exchange Rate on the
converting into Canadian dollars of the U.S. dollar proceeds of all of any class of Debt: Obligations
repayable in U.S. dollars incurred by CFLCo to finance the construction and bringing into operation
of the Plant or for the refinancing from time to time of Debt Obligations originally incurred to finance
or refinance such construction and bringing into operation and (ii) the exchange rate applicable upon
any purchase of U.S. dollars by CFLCo for current servicing of each such Debt Obligation of such
class then, on each purchase of U.S. dollars for servicing of any such Debt Obligation, the difference
experienced shall be for the respective accounts of CFLCo and Hydro-Quebec on the following
basis:
14.1.1 Where the Weighted Average Exchange Rate was .925 or less, the difference aforesaid shall be for the accounts equally of CFLCo and Hydro-Quebec to the extent of 4¢ U.S. for
each U.S. dollar purchased and beyond that solely for the account of Hydro-Quebec;
but less than 14.1.2 Where the Weighted Average Exchange Rate was more than .925 but less
.965, the difference aforesaid shall be for the accounts equally of CFLCo and Hydro-Quebec to
the extent of 5¢ U.S. for each U.S. dollar purchased and beyond that solely for the account of
Hydro-Quebec; and
14.1.3 Where the Weighted Average Exchange Rate was .965 or more, the difference
aforesaid shall be for the accounts equally of CFLCo and Hydro-Quebec to the extent of 6¢ U.S.
for each U.S. dollar purchased and beyond that solely for the account of Hydro-Quebec.
14.2 Deemed Conversion
Any U.S. funds which CFLCo may receive free of escrow or pledge in respect of any Debt Obligation referred to in Section 14.1 which CFLCo employs without converting them to Canadian dollars
shall, for the purpose of Section 14.1, be deemed to have been converted to Canadian dollars at the
exchange rate for sales of U.S. dollars quoted by the Bank of Canada in effect at noon on the day
CFLCo would first have been free to convert such U.S. funds into Canadian funds.
14.3 U. S. Refinancing of U. S. Debt Obligations
Any U.S. Debt Obligation incurred by CFLCo, the proceeds of which are employed to repay an
earlier U.S. Debt Obligation of CFLCo, shall, to the extent so employed, be deemed for the purposes
23
of Section 14.1(i) to be a continuation of such earlier U.S. Debt Obligation and to have already been
converted into Canadian dollars at the time such earlier U.S. Debt Obligation was so converted or
deemed to have been converted.
14.4 Subsequent U. S. Debt Obligations
Subject to Section 14.3 should CFLCo, after any calculation of Weighted Average Exchange
Rate for the purposes of this Article, thereafter incur any additional Debt Obligation repayable in
U.S. dollars the Weighted Average Exchange Rate will be recalculated but without retroactive effect.
ARTICLE XV

8. Governor and Excitation Systems
CFLCo shall submit to Hydro-Quebec for approval the specifications, supplier proposals' and drawings for the govermor and excitation systems of the generating units. The governor and excitation
systems shall be modifted, should the need arise, at the request or with the consent of Hydro-Quebec,
to incorporate technical improvements that may be made in this field.
The governors will be oil-pressure operated and of the electro-hydraulic, cabinet actuator type. The electrical part of the governor will be fully transistorized. They will be provided with temporary speed droop, accelerometric compensation, speed regulation using load feedback, and watt joint control
equipment suitable for future connection to supervisory and load frequency control systems.
The governing system should be of such a type as to allow the use of batteries for starting and
emergency only assuming full oil pressure on the governor at all times. The rest of the time, the
governor should take its power from a permanent magnet generator or from the station service. The
speed switches should not be affected by emergeney conditions on the station service.
The principal characteristics of the governors will be:
(a) gain and time constant of temporary speed droop, fully adjustable.
(b) amount of speed regulation, adjustable from 0 to 10%.
(c) width of the dead-band, adjustable from 0 to 0.25 Hertz,
The excitation system will consist of solid state controlled rectifiers protected from surge over voltages by suitably chosen surge protective devices and supplied from transformers connected to
the generator terminals.
The rating of the excitation system will be not less than the excitation required for the generator
when delivering 110 per cent rated capacity at 105 per cent rated voltage. The system will have a
ceiling of 6.4 per unit based on the no load air gap line feld voltage, and will operate satisfactorily
over the following range:
Voltage
Frequency
30 per cent -150 per cent rated
90 per cent -150 per cent rated
Negative field current will not be required. Var joint control equipment similar to watt control
equipment should be provided.
The excitation system will be provided with a stabilizing signal which has been proven able
to damp in a minimum time the oscillations that can happen on the system. This stabilizing signal
shall be automatically cancelled in the event of total load rejection in order to prevent dangerous
dynamic over-voltages. The regulator time constant will be less than 0.03 seconds and the regulator gain will be adjustable up to 200.
The settings for the adjustable characteristics of the governor and excitation systems will be
established by Hydro-Quebec and shall be used by CFLCo. To ensure reliable system operation and
system stability, these settings will be modified by CFLCo when required with the consent of Hydro- Quebec or at the request of Hydro-Quebec.
Hydro-Quebec's representatives may, at their option, assist at the acceptance tests on the governor
and excitation systems. CFLCo shall perform certain tests on the governor and excitation systems
at the request of Hydro-Quebec or permit Hydro-Quebec to perform these tests in order to obtain
characteristics required by Hydro-Quebec for system studies.

4.1 Operation
4.1.1 Operational Flexibility
ARTICLE IV
OPERATION OF THE PLANT
The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for Hydro-Quebec to have the benefit of operational flexibility of CFLCo's facilities in relation to the Hydro-Quebec system. Accordingly:
(i) Hydro-Quebec may request CFLCo to operate the Plant so as to supply Hydro-Quebec's
schedule of power requirements, provided that no such request shall be less than the Minimum
Capacity or, except as provided in Section 5.2, more than the Firm Capacity;
(ii) Hydro-Quebec may require deliveries which have the effect of varying the amount of
water to be carried in storage at any time, provided that, in so doing, sufficient water is left in
storage so that Minimum Capacity can always be maintained;
(iii) CFLCo agrees to make available to Hydro-Quebec information relating to the hydrology
of the drainage basin and the levels of the reservoirs and the measurement and metering of any
spillage from the reservoirs, and to co-operate fully with Hydro-Quebec in the forecasting of
energy which can be made available.
4.1.2 Existing Obligations
Hydro-Quebec acknowledges and agrees that CFLCo has existing obligations to supply power and
energy in respect of the Twin Falls Power Corporation Limited loads, that no provision hereof shall
operate to hinder or prevent the fulfilment by CFLCo of its said obligations to Twin Falls Power
Corporation Limited covering 225,000 kilowatts at 100% load factor and that the fulflment of such
obligation shall not constitute recapture under Section 5.4.
4.1.3 Protection of Recapture
Hydro-Quebec shall not request CFLCo to operate the Plant in a manner which would prevent
CFLCo from having available any power and energy which CFLCo may recapture pursuant to Section 5.4.
4.1.4 Maintenance
CFLCo shall maintain serviceable and in good repair, in accordance with sound utility practice,
all necessary facilities of the Plant. To enable Hydro-Quebec to verify compliance with this obligation,
CFLCo shall afford full access to the Plant to Hydro-Quebec personnel who will be accommodated
on the site of the Plant at Hydro-Quebec's expense. Should Hydro-Quebec notify CFLCo of any condition which may prevent delivery of Firm Capacity and energy, CFLCo shall, not later than 15 days after receipt of such notice, either (a) proceed diligently with the work of maintenance or repair
called for by such notice and complete the same with all reasonable despatch or (b) inform Hydro- Quebec that, for reasons which CFLCo shall state, such work is not necessary to maintain said
facilities serviceable in accordance with sound utility practice and undertake that, if a penalty or
penalties are incurred as a result of such work not being performed, then such penalty or penalties
will apply at 110% of the amounts otherwise payable under Article VIII. Moreover, Hydro-Quebec
in such event shall retain all legal recourses otherwise available to it for damages suffered in excess
of the penalty or penalties.
to
4.1.5 Right of Hydro-Quebec to Operate
Should CFLCo, not being prevented by any event of Force Majeure, be unwilling at any time
operate the Plant, and should the Plant then be operable, Hydro-Quebec, if not then in default
4
hereunder, shall have the right to cause the Plant to be operated for the account of CFLCo
accordance with sound utility practice until CFLCo itself resumes such operation.
4.1.6 Operation of Reservoir
in
Hydro-Quebec shall not request CFLCo to operate the Plant in such a manner as to imperil
the equipment or facilities thereof or so that the security of the reservoir structures is endangered,
and shall not request operation which would require that water levels be carried higher than those
established by engineering criteria for free-board as contained in Schedule I.
4.1.7 Operating Manual
For the purpose of the present Power Contract the parties shall, by mutual agreement, revise
and maintain up to date in the light of the experience gained in operating the Plant the detailed
operating manual which they have established covering all procedures of interrelated operations. The
revision and maintaining up to date of such operating manual shall be the sole responsibility of the
parties hereto without reference to any assignee of this Power Contract as security.
4.1.8 Control of Frequency and Power
For the purpose hereof, Hydro-Quebec shall be responsible for regulating frequency and CFLCO
shall be responsible for power and reactive flows in the transmission circuits of the Plant, to meet
the schedules to be provided by Hydro-Quebec pursuant hereto. Each party shall so operate its
system as to minimize voltage and power swings transmitted to the system of the other party.
4.2 Interruptions
(i) Either party may at any time, for the purpose of safeguarding human life or protecting from
major damage the storage, generating or transmission facilities of CFLCo or the Hydro-Quebec
system, discontinue or reduce, but only to the extent necessary, the supply or taking of power and
energy hereunder.
Each party shall be prompt and diligent in removing the cause of any such discontinuance
reduction and to this end shall maintain an adequate reserve of spare parts and apparatus.
or
The party on whose system the cause of an interruption shall have occurred shall inform the
other of such cause as soon as possible after the interruption has occurred and, when feasible, shall
state the estimated duration of such interruption. Any such information conveyed verbally shall be
confirmed in writing without delay.
(ii) If CFLCo should find it necessary or advisable to take out of service, for the purposes
of making repairs, renewals, or replacements, two or more units or their associated equipment, HydroQuebec will cooperate in estimating, to the best of its knowledge, what might be the most suitable
time for CFLCo to do so in order to reduce or eliminate the penalty which CFLCo might incur for
failure to provide Firm Capacity. All such discontinuances and reductions in the supply of power
and energy, total or partial, shall be of minimum duration and, when possible, arranged for at a time
least objectionable to Hydro-Quebec.
4.3 Communications System
The parties shall maintain such continuous and reliable communications between their respective
power systems as may be required for operation, protection, automatic computer control, data transmission, telemetering and voice channels.
CFLCo shall, at its sole expense construct, own, operate and maintain that part of the communications system which is at the Plant or which is on the Plant side of the Delivery Point. Hydro-Quebec
shall, at its sole expense, construct, own, operate and maintain the remainder of said system.
5
4.4 Metering and Measurement
The parties shall maintain adequate and reliable metering facilities to measure power and
energy and to give such other measurements as may be required by the parties.
The metering and measuring facilities of Hydro-Quebec shall, at its sole expense, be installed,
maintained and operated by Hydro-Quebec at the intermediate station on its system nearest the
Delivery Point and, subject to such adjustments as are required to reflect delivery at the Delivery
Point, shall be used for billing purposes. Hydro-Quebec shall communicate to CFLCo all information
on measurement from said facilities.
The metering and measuring facilities of CFLCo shall, at its sole expense, be installed, maintained
and operated by CFLCo at the Plant. Hydro-Quebec may from time to time, at its sole option and
expense, install, maintain and operate duplicates of all or any such facilities of CFLCo and CFLCo
shall furnish the space and access reasonably necessary for such purpose. Hydro-Quebec may at any
time, at its expense, remove, with or without replacement, all or any of such duplicate facilities.
All meters and measuring facilities, to be used or which may be used for billing, shall be
periodically tested and such meters calibrated if necessary in accordance with agreed standards at
least as high as those established by the Department of Trade and Commerce of Canada. Each
party shall give adequate prior notice to the other of any test which it intends to conduct and the
other may send authorized representatives who shall be entitled to attend and witness the test.
Any meter or other measuring facility which fails to function or which functions incorrectly, shall
be promptly adjusted, repaired or replaced by a like facility having the required accuracy. Each
party shall, promptly on request from the other, test its metering and measuring facilities.
Should any meter or other measuring facility used for billing purposes break down or be found
not to have the required accuracy, CFLCo and Hydro-Quebec shall determine (from CFLCo's own
facilities and from such information as Hydro-Quebec may supply, and Hydro-Quebec shall be
entitled to do so) the amount of power and energy supplied during the period of failure or inaccuracy
and the duration of such period. In making such determinations the parties hereto shall rely on that
data and information available to them as aforesaid which the parties consider most conducive
as accurate a determination as the circumstances may permit.

effect and at weekly intervals thereafter Hydro-Quebec shall furnish to CFLCO:
(a) an hourly schedule of its proposed capacity requirements over the week following, and
(b) an estimate of what Hydro-Quebec is likely to schedule over the three weeks thereafter.
Each such seven-day schedule shall constitute Hydro-Quebec's request for availability of such capacity
over the period scheduled to the various extents and at the various times indicated by the schedule,
but subject to Hydro-Quebec's right to make further requests for changes in capacity during the period
within the limits of Firm Capacity and Minimum Capacity. Any such request shall be considered as
revising the schedule to the required extent and for the required time.
5.4 Recapture
CFLCo may, on not less than three years prior written notice to Hydro-Quebec, elect to withhold
from the power and energy agreed to be sold hereunder blocks at a specified load factor per month,
to be stated in said notice, of not less than 60% nor more than 90%, which blocks in the aggregate shall
not exceed, during the term hereof and after taking into account recaptures made by CFLCo under
the original Power Contract, 300,000 kilowatts for a maximum withholding thereunder and hereunder
of 2.362 billion kilowatthours per year provided that:
(i) energy so withheld is sold by CFLCo only for consumption outside the Province of
Quebec; and
(ii) any part of the energy so withheld which, from time to time may become available for
purchase by Hydro-Quebec may be purchased by Hydro-Quebec at the price of one mill per
kilowatthour, and to this end Hydro-Quebec shall have access to the pertinent sales records.
