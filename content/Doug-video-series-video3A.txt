## OVERVIEW: QUEBEC'S ELECTRICITY SUPPLY PICTURE

### Total Available Electricity = Domestic Production + Imports

**Visual representation in data:**
- Blue line: Domestic electricity produced in Quebec
  - Follows expected seasonal patterns
  - Shows slight downward slope due to drought
  
- Green line: Total electricity available to Quebec
  - Gap between green and blue = imports

**Import sources (shown in chart):**
- Red: Imports from other provinces (main source)
  - Seasonal variation with summer bumps
- Blue tip: Imports from United States
  - Gap between blue and red lines
  - Increasing in recent years

---

## IMPORT SOURCES: THREE PROVINCES

### Source Provinces
1. Ontario
2. New Brunswick  
3. Newfoundland and Labrador

---

## IMPORTS FROM ONTARIO

### 2024 Import Activity

**Volume:**
- Significant amounts purchased in 2024
- Example period: 97,464 megawatts in very short time period
- Possibly around Christmas time (peak demand)

**Pricing characteristics:**
- **Dynamic pricing in effect** (not set prices)
- Price depends on market conditions of supply and demand
- Varies month to month
- Varies day to day
- Can even vary during the day in various markets
- **Set prices are NOT the norm in these markets**

**Actual price paid:**
- **$32.63 per megawatt-hour**
- Equivalent: **3.23 cents per kilowatt-hour**

(Note: Industry uses megawatt-hours; household prices expressed in kilowatt-hours)

## WHY HYDRO-QUÉBEC IMPORTS

### Optimization Strategy

**Simultaneous import/export:**
- May import AND export during same month
- May even happen partially during same day

**Strategic goal:**
- Optimize use of reservoirs as "storage batteries"
- Optimize power use to help minimize costs
- Key objective: **Cost minimization**

**Reservoir management strategy:**
- Save water when can import cheaply
- Release water (generate power) when can sell at high prices
- Arbitrage across time and price variations

---

## IMPORTS FROM NEW BRUNSWICK

### Trading Relationship

**Nature of trade:**
- Hydro-Québec trades electricity with New Brunswick
- Both exports AND imports occur
- Connection point: Eel River high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converter station

**Pricing:**
- Consistent with dynamic pricing model
- Common price range: **8-10 cents per kilowatt-hour**
- Equivalent: **$80-100 per megawatt-hour**

**Recent trend:**
- Imports from New Brunswick (and possibly Ontario) have increased
- **Reason:** Decreasing hydro generation in Quebec due to drought over past couple of years

---

## IMPORTS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR (CHURCHILL FALLS)

### Volume and Importance

**Assumption:** 90% of Churchill Falls electricity goes to Quebec

**Market share:**
- Churchill Falls contributed approximately **86-88% of provincial imports into Quebec**
- Years: 2023 and 2024
- **"This is where the main action is in terms of imports for Hydro-Québec"**

### Pricing Structure

**Approximate price to Quebec from CF(L)Co:**
- **0.475 cents per kilowatt-hour** (about half a cent)
- This includes guaranteed winter availability premium

**CRITICAL ADJUSTMENT - Effective Price:**
- Since Hydro-Québec owns 34.2% of CF(L)Co
- Effective price after ownership adjustment: **0.308 cents per kilowatt-hour**
- "That's pretty small"

**Cost of production:**
- Cost of power: **0.294 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024**

**Data source:** Downloaded from Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro - CF(L)Co financial statements for 2024

### Price Comparison Summary

**Churchill Falls effective price:** 0.308¢/kWh
**Ontario imports:** 3.23¢/kWh  
**New Brunswick imports:** 8-10¢/kWh

**Churchill Falls is 10-33 times cheaper than other provincial imports**

---

## IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES

### Source Specification
- Primarily from New York State
- Hydro-Québec doesn't appear to import from other states
- Has transmission lines to Maine and New York
- Has transmission lines into New England ISO

### Historical Import Patterns (2015-2025)

**2015-2021:**
- Very little import activity from U.S.
- Some action in January (power shortages)
- Can identify January months by "little bumps" in data
- Big bump in January 2022 for some reason

**Recent years (2023-2025):**
- **Big increases in imports from U.S.**
- Now a significant feature on the map
- **Reason:** Climate change and drought reducing Quebec's own generation

---

## U.S. IMPORT PRICING DYNAMICS

### Market Characteristics
- **Free market exchange**
- Market changes month to month
- Presumably can change on daily basis
- Data source: Canada Energy Regulator

**Data quality note:**
Dr. May's observation: "Sometimes the data just doesn't seem to be that consistent. That's a nice way of putting it."
- Has emailed Canada Energy Regulator several times
- Has not received response
- Requests viewers share any information they can obtain about data consistency

### Historical Price Patterns

**January 2022 (high import volume period):**
- Price: **$200 per megawatt-hour**
- Equivalent: **20 cents per kilowatt-hour**
- Very high due to extreme demand

**Pattern observations:**
- Big price increases in January months
- Big price increases in winter generally
- **Increasing trend over time** due to:
  - Climate change
  - Technological change
  - Growing populations
  - Other U.S. factors

**Expected trend:** Upward price trajectory

**Most recent data - July 2025:**
- Import price from New York: **$70.40 per megawatt-hour**
- Equivalent: **7.4 cents per kilowatt-hour**
- "Still a fair amount of money"
- **Certainly a lot more expensive than Churchill Falls imports**

---

## SUPPLY-DEMAND GAP ANALYSIS

### The Tightening Situation

**Diagram interpretation:**
- Green line: Total electricity available (supply)
- Domestic demand line
- Gap between them = available for export

**Historical pattern (before 2023):**
- Fair gap between supply and demand
- Excess available for export

**2023:** 
- Gap closed down
- "They really thought they had a problem"

**2024:**
- "Got more of a problem"

**2025 (April-July period):**
- "Seems to have even more of a problem"
- **Demand meets supply**
- "Basically have nothing available for export"

### The Export Dilemma

**Quebec's objective:** Be a net exporter

**Requirements to achieve this:**
- Must find extra power available
- Want green energy (part of long-term plan to 2035)
- Promoting green energy strategy

**Infrastructure investments:**
- New transmission lines into New England through Maine
- New transmission lines into New York
- **Want to export to New York** because of high free-market prices

## WHERE CHURCHILL RIVER PROJECTS FIT IN

### Primary Purpose of Proposed Projects

**Main function:**
1. **Cheap source of imported power to Quebec**
2. **Meeting peak load demands**

### Strategic Reservoir Management

**The arbitrage opportunity:**
- Save water in Quebec's reservoirs when can import cheaply from Churchill Falls
- Export Quebec's reservoir water when prices are highest

**When to export for maximum profit:**
- January and February (highest prices)
- July and August (secondary peaks, lesser extent)

### Business Certainty vs. Market Volatility

**Business preference:** Set annual prices (certainty)

**Free market reality:** Highly uncertain
- Prices vary month to month (somewhat predictable pattern)
- Prices vary day to day (somewhat predictable pattern)
- **Big unknown:** Next 5 years outlook

**U.S. projections:**
- Demand for renewable electricity could increase by approximately **25% over next 5 years**
- This would drive prices even higher

---

## EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Construction Jobs

**Historical context:**
- Jobs during construction projects = historical issue
- Goes back century or more in Newfoundland and Labrador

**Specific historical reference:**
- Beginning of Second World War
- Canadian and American war effort came to Newfoundland and Labrador
- Bases to be built, airfields to be built
- Construction employment was significant

**Implication:** MOU projects would provide similar construction employment benefits

## KEY TAKEAWAYS (STORYLINE SUMMARY)

### Import Price Hierarchy

**From cheapest to most expensive:**
1. Churchill Falls: 0.308¢/kWh effective (0.475¢/kWh nominal)
2. Ontario: 3.23¢/kWh (10× more than Churchill Falls)
3. U.S. (July 2025): 7.4¢/kWh (24× more than Churchill Falls)
4. New Brunswick: 8-10¢/kWh (26-32× more than Churchill Falls)
5. U.S. (peak periods): Up to 20¢/kWh (65× more than Churchill Falls)

### Supply Crisis Worsening

2. Quebec's domestic generation declining due to drought
3. Gap between supply and demand closing rapidly
4. By 2025, virtually nothing available for export
5. Must import to meet domestic demand

### Churchill Falls' Critical Value

6. Provides 86-88% of provincial imports
7. By far the cheapest import source
8. Allows Quebec to save its reservoir water for high-price export opportunities
9. Essential for Quebec to maintain its export business model

### Market Dynamics

10. All non-Churchill Falls sources use dynamic pricing
11. Prices highly variable and trending upward
12. U.S. demand expected to rise 25% in next 5 years
13. This makes Churchill Falls' low, stable pricing increasingly valuable

### Strategic Importance of MOU Projects

14. Proposed Churchill River projects = cheap imported power for Quebec
15. Allow Quebec to continue exporting at peak prices
16. Provide certainty in uncertain free markets
17. Essential for Quebec's long-term strategy as net exporter
