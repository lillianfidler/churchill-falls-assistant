What We’ve Learned so Far
About HQ’s Exports
.
• Dramatic Changes in the HQ picture with respect to the quantity
of electricity exported:
• Exports as a percentage of total available electricity have generally been
declining!
• Exports to other provinces in Aug 2025 were down almost 58% from three years
earlier.
• Exports to the USA in Aug 2025 were down almost 94% from three years earlier.
• Exports to other provinces (NB) in 2025 are generally greater than to the USA over the
year.
• Exports to the USA exceed those to other provinces during the winter months, when
electricity prices in the northeastern USA are particularly high.
• Net exports to the USA are generally negative, meaning the USA imports more than
it exports.
• According to data from the Canada Energy Regulator, HQ appears to export to Maine
and New York, but not to New England, where it has new transmission lines and
agreements with the New England ISO.

Quebec’s Export Patterns
• Exports seem to occur primarily in the colder winter months and
also, but to a lesser extent, in the hotter summer months.
• Climate and climate change are important on the demand side
and on the supply side (drought).
• Longer term commitments to NB are beginning to dominate
exports to the USA

• What we’ve learned so far with respect to the prices of HQ’s
exports to the USA:
• The most reliable information is likely to come from HQ itself, as CER data
appears inconsistent with respect to value and price data in New York.
• CER report no HQ exports into NE, but HQ’s mid-year publication states
otherwise.
• HQ is a profit maximizer in terms of exports.
• It’s plausible that NL exports from CF to HQ enables HQ to export
electricity at very profitable prices to the US markets.

HQ’s Semi-Annual Report
Comments on Export Markets in the
1st Half of 2025
“The company increased electricity
exports to take advantage of high prices in
a context marked by strong demand.”
On markets outside Québec, weather
conditions experienced during the first few
months of the year led to an overall
increase in energy prices.
This was especially true in New England,
Hydro-Québec’s primary export market.

Escalating Electricity Prices in
Competitive Export Markets
• According to the CER (Canada Energy Regulator) , the average price of
electricity exported from Quebec to Maine in the first quarter of 2025
was $177.95 CAD/MWh (17.80¢ CAD/kWh).
• HQ exports more electricity when prices are high, which accounts for the high
year-to-date export prices.
• Export data into the same market for the same period in 2024 was
8.32¢/kwh or a 114% increase!
• Part of the increase can be attributed to the colder winter in 2025;
however, the actual increase is significantly greater than the 2%
increase specified in the MOU, which has a set annual rate. Those
prices are detached from market realities, especially in the rapidly
evolving electricity market.

• HQ is involved in power projects in NB and has long term
commitments including one to 2040.
• The exports although reflecting seasonal patterns seems lower
after 2022.

Export Prices to New Brunswick
• According to my information, there is no fixed rate but rather a rate
that reflects market conditions. To my knowledge these rates are
not made public.

Answering Our Question:
Do current export prices faced by HQ tell us anything about potential
future price escalations?
• Answer: Yes, I believe so. The prices in the USA are more
competitive, especially for natural gas, which is needed to power
turbines that produce electricity. Natural gas is the closest
alternative to wind and water for HQ at present. These free
markets reflect variations in demand and supply throughout the
day, throughout the year, and over time. The electricity market in
the USA is very dramatic and will change radically over the next
few years.
• Support for the relevance of using US prices is provided by the
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in the next slide.

• Although we do not know the specifics of HQ’s export prices to
New Brunswick Power, we do know the pricing is not set during the
year or over the years. Also, note that the long-term contract lasts
until 2040; it is not for 51 years.
