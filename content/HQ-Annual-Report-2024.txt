FINANCIAL RESULTS 2024

Net income was $2.7 billion, down from $3.3 billion in 2023, a decrease of $625 million. The stated reason was mild temperatures in Quebec and below-normal water inflows for the second year in a row. Total revenue was $16.113 billion, up slightly from $16.086 billion in 2023, comprising $15.578 billion in electricity sales and $535 million in other revenue.

Investments in Quebec totalled $6.0 billion, up from $4.9 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.1 billion or 20%, for the purpose of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.

Total contribution to the Quebec government was $4.0 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion in net income, $0.7 billion in water-power royalties, $0.3 billion in public utilities tax, $0.2 billion in guarantee fees related to debt, and $0.1 billion in contributions to government funds and agencies.

ELECTRICITY SALES 2024

Total electricity sales were 192.3 TWh. Sales in Quebec were 177.2 TWh, virtually identical to 2023's 177.3 TWh, generating revenue of $13.515 billion which was an increase of $564 million from 2023. Sales outside Quebec (exports) were 15.1 TWh with revenue of $2.365 billion at an average export price of 9.9 cents per kWh, with revenue decreasing by $866 million from 2023.

Quebec sales by segment broke down as residential at 38% (approximately 67.3 TWh), large industrial at 31% (approximately 54.9 TWh), commercial, institutional, and small industrial at 27% (approximately 47.8 TWh), and other at 4% (approximately 7.1 TWh).

ELECTRICITY PRICING 2024

The residential rate in Quebec was 8.05 cents per kWh, which Hydro-Quebec states is the lowest in North America. The average export price was 9.9 cents per kWh.

Rate indexations effective April 1, 2024 were: domestic rates for residential and farm capped at 3%, business customer rates increased by 5.1%, and the large-power industrial Rate L increased by 3.3%.

CHURCHILL FALLS REFERENCES

Board Chair Manon Brouillette stated: "In addition, we gave the green light to the non-binding agreement in principle for hydroelectric generation in Labrador, signed in December."

CEO Michael Sabia stated: "Our collaborative approach extends beyond Quebec itself. The memorandum of understanding signed with our neighbours in Newfoundland and Labrador provides an outline of the new agreement that will replace the outdated agreement for Churchill Falls generating station, which has been the source of much discontent for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. The agreement lays the groundwork for a win-win partnership that will contribute to Quebec's energy security for the next 50 years at competitive prices, while also providing our partners with new opportunities and benefits."

INVESTMENT BREAKDOWN 2024

Total investments of $6.0 billion comprised $3.6 billion for large-scale projects for long-term asset operability, grid robustness enhancement, equipment modernization, and end-of-life equipment replacement, and $2.4 billion for development projects for capacity expansion, growth, increased generation capacity, growing customer base handling, and increased energy exchange capacity with neighbouring markets.

Specific project investments included $0.7 billion for the Hertel-New York interconnection line to connect with the Champlain Hudson Power Express line delivering electricity into New York City, $0.3 billion for the Appalaches-Maine interconnection line as part of a new 1,200 MW interconnection between Quebec and New England, $2.0 billion for transmission substations and lines, $1.0 billion for dams and hydroelectric generating stations, $0.7 billion for growth in customer base, $0.5 billion for distribution asset sustainment, $0.3 billion for computer and telecommunications equipment, and $0.5 billion for other purposes.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 2024

Average outage duration dropped by over 50% compared to 2023. Average wait time for connection-related work requests decreased by 20%. Energy savings increased by over 30% compared to 2023, with the stated impact being that kilowatt-hours saved will allow Quebec to meet growth in electricity demand with fewer new facilities, positively impacting rates.

FACTORS AFFECTING 2024 PERFORMANCE

Temperature impact on sales was negative 1.2 TWh or negative $107 million compared to 2023. Hydro-Quebec states 2024 temperatures in Quebec were the warmest on record, with nearly 90% of winter 2023-2024 days above climate normals. February was on average 4 degrees Celsius higher than the previous year. The first quarter saw a decrease of 1.5 TWh or $135 million, while the fourth quarter was slightly colder than 2023, providing an increase of 0.4 TWh or $40 million. Heating accounts for the vast majority of electricity consumption during winter months.

Water inflow was below normal for the second year in a row, contributing significantly to the decline in net income.

Baseload demand increased by 1.1 TWh or $118 million due to increased residential energy needs, growth in the commercial, institutional, and small industrial segment, demographic change leading to growth in customer accounts, and the leap year providing an additional day of sales.

Rate indexations contributed $508 million in revenue, and higher aluminum prices contributed an additional $53 million from electricity sales in Quebec.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Action Plan 2035 was launched in November 2023 for energy transition, replacing polluting fossil fuels with renewable energy, with noted impact of significant increase in electricity demand requiring more generation, more investment, and wiser consumption.

Strategic documents launched in 2024 included a Wind Power Development Strategy, three partnership agreements for wind power potential up to 5,000 MW, a Sustainable Development Plan, a plan to upgrade the main transmission system, and a Strategy for Economic Reconciliation and to Strengthen Relations with First Nations and Inuit.

Three wind power partnership agreements were signed in 2024 for the Wocawson zone in Bas-Saint-Laurent, the Chamouchouane zone in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, and the Nutinamu-Chauvin zone in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, with total potential up to 5,000 MW.

INDIGENOUS RELATIONS

The Strategy for Economic Reconciliation launched in December 2024 aims to create opportunities for Indigenous communities to participate as full partners in large-scale infrastructure projects, enable communities to gain tangible and sustainable benefits, make Hydro-Quebec more open and inclusive, and ensure Indigenous people play a greater role at all levels.

Victoria LaBillois of the Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation was appointed as the first Indigenous person on the Board of Directors in 2024.
