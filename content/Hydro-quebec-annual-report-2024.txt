"Our collaborative approach extends beyond Quebec itself. The memorandum of understanding signed with our neighbours in Newfoundland and Labrador provides an outline of the new agreement that will replace the outdated agreement for Churchill Falls generating station, which has been the source of much discontent for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.

The agreement lays the groundwork for a win-win partnership that will contribute to Québec's energy security for the next 50 years at competitive prices, while also providing our partners with new opportunities and benefits."
