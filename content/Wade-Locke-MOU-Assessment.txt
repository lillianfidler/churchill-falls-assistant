WADE LOCKE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: CHURCHILL FALLS MOU ASSESSMENT
December 12, 2024 MOU between Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec
===================================

AUTHOR: Wade Locke, Ph.D. (retired Professor of Economics, Memorial University of Newfoundland)

DOCUMENT TYPE: Independent economic analysis and critique of Churchill Falls MOU

DATE: December 2024 (analysis of MOU signed December 12, 2024)

PERSPECTIVE: Critical economic assessment examining whether MOU represents good value for Newfoundland and Labrador

KEY THEME: "The MOU document lacks sufficient detail needed to demonstrate that the deal or the contract that is expected to ensue from this MOU is better than the 1969 contract."

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Central Question

**Is this a good deal, a great deal, or the best deal Newfoundland and Labrador could have negotiated?** Or is the MOU "the start of another bad deal in which Newfoundland and Labrador has been snookered again, but this time in a more sophisticated way than in 1969?"

### Locke's Overall Assessment

**Cautiously optimistic with significant concerns:**

✅ **Positives:**
- Revenues substantial and potentially transformative
- Some protection from cost overruns and delays
- Significant increase in power available for Labrador (183% increase)
- Substantial immediate revenue increase

⚠️ **Concerns:**
- Insufficient information in MOU to thoroughly evaluate projects
- Province NOT protected from all risks
- Will require borrowing close to current level of net debt
- Many legitimate questions remain unanswered
- Lack of detail on key financial mechanisms

**Closing warning:** "We still need to be wary of being snookered by others with more sophistication but different long-term goals and interests. We should learn from our history, not be constrained by it."

---

## BACKGROUND: THE 1969 CONTRACT CONTEXT

### Original Churchill Falls Contract Terms

**Initial 40 years (1969-2016):**
- Price: **0.25¢/kWh**

**Renewal period (2016-2041):**
- Price: **0.2¢/kWh** (LOWER than original)

### NL's Power Access Under 1969 Contract

**Two blocks of power:**
1. **300 MW recall power** - for Labrador electricity needs
2. **225 MW Twinco (Twin Falls) block** - for Labrador mining companies

**Remaining electricity:** Could be purchased by Hydro-Québec, including any power excess to NL needs

### Historical Context on Surplus Recall Block

**1998-2001:** NL had ~130 MW surplus from recall block
- Sold excess to HQ at market price
- Three-year agreement estimated at $68.5 million
- **Renewed 2001:** HQ paid $23.9/MWh, revenue capped at $97.5M
- **Renewed 2004:** Price started at $36/MWh, escalating 2% annually, no revenue cap
- **2009:** NLH could trade energy with customers outside Quebec (subject to transmission tariffs)

### The Historic Inequity

**As of 2019:**
- Quebec profits from Churchill Falls: **~$28 billion**
- Newfoundland and Labrador profits: **~$2 billion**

**Feehan and Baker (2010) assessment:**
- With revenues of $60M annually during renewal contract
- "Unlikely that CF(L)Co will cover its operating costs"
- "Making it necessary to cross-subsidize the arrangement with revenues from other sources"

**Result:** "The 1969 Churchill Falls was the bane of the existence of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians"

## MOU CLAIMED BENEFITS (GOVERNMENT OF NL FACT SHEET)

### Overall Revenue Claims

**Total revenue to NL:** More than $225 billion

**Breakdown:**
1. **Churchill Falls alone:** $17 billion over next 17 years (2025-2041)
   - **Average:** $1 billion/year starting 2025
2. **New developments:** Additional revenue streams

### Pricing Changes

**Price increase:** 0.2¢/kWh → **5.9¢/kWh** (effective average)
- **30× higher** than current price
- Will **escalate over time**
- **Tied to market prices**

**Payment to CF(L)Co:**
- **$33.8 billion** in today's dollars (present value)
- **$180 billion** in nominal dollars over term

### New Capacity

**Total new capacity:** 3,900 MW
- Gull Island: 2,250 MW
- Churchill Falls expansion: 1,100 MW
- Churchill Falls upgrades: 550 MW

**NL power access:** Nearly 4× current allocation for Labrador use

### Risk Protection Claims

- "Fully protected" from construction risk and cost overruns
- New pricing NOT contingent on new projects proceeding
- Can analyze pricing separately from development projects

### Construction and Economic Benefits

- Thousands of jobs during construction
- Enhanced industrial development potential in Labrador
- Binding agreements to be signed by April 2026

### HQ Payment for Development Rights

**$3.5 billion** (today's dollars) for right to co-develop new projects
- Equivalent to **$4.8 billion** in nominal dollars

### Project Costs

**Total construction costs:** $35.0 billion (appears to be nominal dollars)

**Breakdown:**
- Gull Island: $29.4 billion (includes financing)
- Churchill Falls expansion: $4.6 billion (includes financing)
- Churchill Falls upgrade: $1.9 billion (includes financing)
- New transmission: $3.6 billion (includes financing)

## LOCKE'S CRITICAL ANALYSIS: KEY CONCERNS AND CORRECTIONS

### Issue 1: Revenue to Treasury vs. Revenue to CF(L)Co

**Government claim:** "$17 billion to treasury" or "$1 billion/year"

**Locke's correction:**
- CF(L)Co will receive $19.8B or $1.17B average to 2041
- **This is NOT money to treasury**
- It's money to CF(L)Co, of which NLH owns 65.8%
- **Amount to provincial treasury:** $13.1B or **$768M annual average** to 2041

**Comparison baseline issue:**
- GNL press release: Compare $1B to "$20 million we receive today"
- **Locke's correction:** CF(L)Co 2023 revenues were $103 million:
  - $40.5M from HQ
  - $25.6M from Guaranteed Winter Availability Contract (GWAC)
  - $34M from NLH
  - $1.2M from other sources
- **Better comparison:** $65M from GWAC and HQ (to be replaced by new PPA)

### Issue 2: Confusion About "Today's Dollars" vs "Nominal Dollars"

**The $33.8 billion figure:**
- This is **present value** of nominal revenue profile
- Discounts nominal cash flow using 5.822% (presumably nominal weighted average cost of capital)
- $33.8B = amount of investment needed today to generate cash flow equivalent to $195B at 5.822% return
- **NOT actual dollars of the day**

**To get dollars of the day equivalent:**
- Need to discount cash flow using assumed inflation rate
- MOU lacks clarity on this distinction

### Issue 3: Misleading Capacity Access Claims

**Claim:** "3,900 MW... nearly four times as much energy for Labrador"

**Locke's clarification:**
- 3,900 MW is COMBINED increase from all projects
- NLH has existing rights to 525 MW (will continue)
- **NLH will have access to:**
  - 605 MW new recapture capacity after 2034
  - 250 MW existing plant capacity after 2050
  - 500 MW existing plant capacity after 2060
  - 360 MW from new developments
- **Total NL capacity:** 1,990 MW
- **Actual increase:** 378% of current 525 MW (not "four times" the energy)

### Issue 4: Insufficient Detail on Pricing Mechanism

**MOU Schedule F states prices will be "reflective of:"**
- Wholesale electricity market value in Quebec
- Replacement costs in Quebec
- Wholesale electricity market value in northeast export markets

**Critical gap:** "No indication of the weights attached to either in the pricing mechanism"

**Implication:** Cannot properly assess future revenue or compare to market alternatives

### Issue 5: Cost Overrun Protection Is Partial, Not Complete

**Claim:** "Fully protected from construction risk and cost overruns"

**Locke's correction - NL IS exposed to:**
- Cost overruns for transmission lines (100% NL responsibility)
- 65.8% of cost overruns on Churchill Falls upgrade
- Only Gull Island and CF expansion have HQ accepting overruns

### Issue 6: Missing Critical Financial Information

**Cannot calculate net present value because MOU omits:**
- Time profile of capital costs
- Time profile of operations and maintenance costs
- Production profile for electricity
- Time profile of expected prices for electricity
- Detailed breakdown of power flows (Gull Island: 84% HQ, 16% NLH)

**Result:** "Not sufficient information in the MOU to thoroughly evaluate all, or any, of the proposed new developments"

### Issue 7: Provincial Debt Implications

**NL will need additional borrowing:** $17-18 billion
- **Context:** Approximately equal to current net provincial debt
- Even after $4.8B from HQ, still major borrowing requirement
- "Not insignificant" financial burden

## EQUITY AND DEBT ANALYSIS

### NLH Equity Obligations (Locke's Approximation)

| Project | Capital Costs | Equity (25% Share) | Implied NLH Equity | Debt (75% Share) | NL Debt |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| Gull Island | $24.9B | $6.23B | $3.735B | $18.68B | $11.21B |
| CF Expansion | $4.6B | $1.15B | $0.757B | $3.45B | $2.27B |
| CF Upgrade | $1.9B | $0.48B | $0.313B | $1.43B | $0.94B |
| CF Transmission | $3.6B | $0.90B | $0.900B | $2.70B | $2.70B |
| **Subtotal** | **$35.0B** | **$8.75B** | **$5.704B** | **$26.25B** | **$17.11B** |

**Notes:**
- Capital costs include financing costs
- NLH equity share: 60% for Gull Island, 65.8% for CF projects, 100% for transmission
- HQ $4.8B transfer reduces NL borrowing requirement
- **Net NL borrowing: ~$17-18 billion** (approximately equal to current provincial net debt)

### HQ Equity Purchase Assessment

**HQ payment:** $3.5B present value ($4.8B nominal) for Gull Island equity

**Transfer structure:**
- First 3 years: Unconditional
- Remainder: Subject to certain conditions being met
- Not strictly an equity purchase

**Cannot fully evaluate** without:
- Net present value calculation for Gull Island
- Comparison: Is 40% of Gull Island NPV > $3.5B present value?
- Missing information prevents this assessment

---

## EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS

### Construction Employment

**Government claims:**
- Average annual 3,000 direct jobs during construction
- Peak of 5,000 direct jobs
- Including indirect/induced: Average 5,000 jobs, peak 9,500 jobs

**Locke's assessment:**
- Construction period: 5-11 years across all projects
- Total direct jobs: 20,000-30,000
- "Should not strain credibility given $35 billion investment cost"

**Skills required:**
- Equipment operators
- Carpenters
- Electricians
- Crane operators
- Line workers
- Office workers
- Accommodations workers

### Power Available for Labrador Development

**Current access:** 525 MW capacity = 167 TWh (2025-2075)

**Under MOU:** 474 TWh

**Increase:** 183% more electricity available in Labrador

**Benefit:** "Should facilitate industrial development"

**Gap in analysis:** "No information in the MOU that would enable one to estimate the potential benefits that flow from this extra electricity"

### Return on NLH Equity in New Developments

**NLH equity in new developments:** $5-6 billion

**Target return on equity:** 8-9%

**Expected annual return:** $400-500 million

## KEY UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

### Financial Transparency Issues

1. **What are the weights in the pricing mechanism?** (Quebec wholesale, replacement cost, export markets)
2. **What is the time profile of capital costs?** (Cannot assess project viability)
3. **What is the production profile for electricity?** (Cannot project revenues)
4. **What is the time profile of expected prices?** (Cannot assess competitiveness)
5. **What are the detailed O&M costs?** (Cannot assess operating margins)

### Risk and Protection Issues

6. **How exposed is NL to transmission cost overruns?** (Potentially significant)
7. **What is the exposure to CF upgrade cost overruns?** (65.8% of overruns)
8. **What conditions must be met for HQ payments?** (After first 3 years)
9. **Will excess Labrador power remain competitive at new higher prices?** (Affects industrial development)
10. **What happens to GWAC replacement revenue?** ($20-30M annually)

### Economic Assessment Issues

11. **What is the net present value of each project?** (Cannot calculate with available info)
12. **Is the HQ equity purchase fair value?** (Need Gull Island NPV to assess)
13. **What are the economic benefits from increased Labrador power?** (No information provided)
14. **Is this better than alternative development scenarios?** (Cannot compare without data)
15. **What is the opportunity cost of 50-year commitments?** (Cannot assess)

---

## COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

### What About Going It Alone?

**Locke does not directly address** this question due to insufficient information

**Would need to know:**
- Alternative markets and pricing
- Transmission costs for other routes
- Project financing costs without HQ partnership
- Risk profile for standalone development

**Historical context:** Feehan article shows 1960s attempts at power corridor through Quebec were blocked

### What About Different Partnership Structures?

**Cannot assess** because MOU lacks detail on:
- Whether different ownership percentages were considered
- Whether alternative pricing mechanisms were evaluated
- Whether other potential partners were approached
- What negotiating leverage NL had

---

## LOCKE'S OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### Positive Elements

✅ **Substantial revenue increase:**
- From $65M (GWAC + HQ) to ~$768M annual average to NL treasury
- Potentially transformative for provincial finances

✅ **Some risk protection:**
- HQ managing and accepting overruns on Gull Island and CF expansion
- Pricing not conditional on new projects proceeding

✅ **Significant power increase for Labrador:**
- 183% increase enables industrial development

✅ **HQ equity payment helps:**
- $4.8B reduces NL borrowing needs
- Makes projects more financially feasible

✅ **No automatic renewal:**
- Avoids 1969 contract mistake of perpetual renewal at lower price

### Concerns and Warnings

⚠️ **Insufficient information:**
- "Not sufficient information in the MOU to thoroughly evaluate all, or any, of the proposed new developments"
- Cannot calculate net present values
- Cannot assess whether deal is optimal

⚠️ **Significant debt burden:**
- $17-18B new borrowing ≈ current total net provincial debt
- Major fiscal implications for province

⚠️ **Incomplete risk protection:**
- NL exposed to transmission cost overruns (100%)
- NL exposed to CF upgrade cost overruns (65.8%)
- Not "fully protected" as claimed

⚠️ **Lack of transparency on pricing:**
- No weights given for pricing formula components
- Cannot assess whether prices will track market fairly

⚠️ **Legitimate questions remain:**
- "Led to a number of analysts raising legitimate questions about the actual benefit"
- "Whether there was a better deal to be had"

### Final Warning

**Locke's closing statement:**

> "Recognizing that our level of analytical sophistication has increased within the province, we still need to be wary of being snookered by others with more sophistication but different long-term goals and interests. We should learn from our history, not be constrained by it. We ought not to be afraid to make a good deal that is in our interest, but we need to be wary given that we do not know the future with precision."

## CONTEXT FOR CHURCHILL FALLS AI AGENT

### How to Use This Analysis

**Locke provides:**
- Independent economic critique from respected MUN economist
- Detailed fact-checking of government claims
- Identification of information gaps in MOU
- Risk assessment of projects
- Financial implications for NL

**Important notes:**
- This is ONE perspective (critical but constructive)
- Locke is NOT saying deal is bad, just that insufficient info to fully assess
- Analysis done with publicly available information only
- More detailed assessment would require confidential negotiating information

### Key Takeaway for Users

When asked about MOU economic viability, AI agent should present:
1. Government's claimed benefits
2. Locke's corrections and concerns
3. Information gaps that prevent full assessment
4. Note that final evaluation requires more detail than MOU provides

**Balance:** MOU represents significant revenue increase BUT lacks transparency needed for thorough independent economic assessment.
