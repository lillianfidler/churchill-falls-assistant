Key Facts from the Document (No Interpretations)

Document: Action Plan 2035 - Towards a Decarbonized and Prosperous Québec
Published: November 2023

===== HQ'S STATED POSITION =====

GLOBAL CONTEXT (as stated by HQ):
- "The global race has begun" - countries rapidly accelerating decarbonization investments
- HQ states Québec has "a head start in this race" due to historical hydropower investments
- Document mentions working with "some of the largest companies in the global energy sector"
- References securing "global supply chain"

QUÉBEC'S POSITION (as stated by HQ):
- Québec's predecessors "bet on hydropower—clean energy"
- This provides clean energy supply for economic development
- HQ aims to provide "reliable electricity supply and high-quality services at the most competitive cost"

===== CAPACITY AND ENERGY NEEDS BY 2035 =====

SPECIFIC NUMBERS STATED BY HQ:

Additional energy needed by 2035: +60 TWh
(Note: This is in addition to 13 TWh or 1,800 MW already included in their November 2022 Electricity Supply Plan)

Additional capacity needed by 2035: +8,000-9,000 MW

BREAKDOWN OF PLANNED SOURCES (as stated in document):

Energy (TWh):
- Improved consumption: 7-9 TWh
- Wind power: 30-35 TWh
- Hydropower: [amount not specified in TWh]
- Other (imports, solar, battery, renewable natural gas): 6-10 TWh

Capacity (MW):
- Improved consumption: 1,600-1,800 MW
- Wind power: 1,500-1,700 MW
- Hydropower: 3,800-4,200 MW
- Other (imports, solar, battery): 500-1,000 MW
- Renewable natural gas: 400-600 MW

===== HQ'S STATEMENTS ABOUT DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCES =====

ON WIND AND SOLAR:
- Document states these are "the most advantageous in terms of rapid rollout, cost and social acceptability"
- However, document notes: "energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, fluctuates as it is dependent on weather conditions (such as wind force and sunlight)"
- States: "we can't control the wind or the behavior of our customers, these solutions alone are not enough"

ON HYDROPOWER:
- Document states: "To ensure the reliability of the power supply, especially during peak periods, Hydro-Québec must include in its energy and capacity balances a sufficient quantity of electricity from firm generation sources like hydropower, which can be mobilized as needed"
- Provides example scenario: "a cold and windless winter day, when thousands of households turn up the heat and start preparing supper"
- States: "It is in cases like these, when a high number of customers are consuming a lot of electricity at the same time, that capacity needs are at their highest"
- Document concludes: "The best choice by far at times like these is hydropower"
- Reasoning given: "By managing our reservoirs optimally, we can ensure that we have enough water to produce the electricity we need, when we need it"
- Final statement: "That's why our strategy must include sufficient hydropower capacity to meet demand when energy efficiency and wind power are not enough"

DEFINITION PROVIDED:
"Firm generation: To ensure the reliability of the power supply, especially during peak periods, Hydro-Québec must include in its energy and capacity balances a sufficient quantity of electricity from firm generation sources like hydropower, which can be mobilized as needed."

===== FIVE STATED PRIORITIES =====

Priority 1: Improve service quality
Priority 2: Help customers make better use of electricity
Priority 3: Increase power generation capacity
Priority 4: Partner with Indigenous communities
Priority 5: Become an agile, innovative and transparent organization

===== COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FOCUS =====

STATEMENTS ABOUT COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS:
- Document mentions "industrial and commercial rates"
- References "residential and commercial customers"
- States they have "a renowned team, made up primarily of commercial delegates and engineers"
- Team provides "customized advice and support"
- References "business community" and securing "global supply chain"

===== FINANCIAL CONTEXT =====

CHALLENGES MENTIONED:
- "scope of work to be accomplished" 
- "pressure stemming from the labor shortage"
- Need to "secure our global supply chain"
- Must maintain service "at the most competitive cost"
- Balance between "investments we will have to make" and maintaining competitive rates

===== SUMMARY OF KEY FACTS =====

1. HQ states it needs +60 TWh additional energy and +8,000-9,000 MW additional capacity by 2035
2. Of that capacity, HQ identifies need for 3,800-4,200 MW from hydropower specifically
3. HQ states wind and solar "fluctuate" and "are not enough" alone
4. HQ identifies hydropower as "firm generation" that can be "mobilized as needed"
5. HQ calls hydropower "the best choice by far" for peak demand periods
6. HQ's strategy "must include sufficient hydropower capacity"
7. HQ references competing in global energy markets and maintaining competitive rates
8. Document is focused on meeting growing electricity demand through 2035
