EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Quebec's electricity import patterns have undergone a remarkable transformation. Once a major exporter to the USA, Hydro-Québec has become a net importer, with imports from the United States increasing 128.9% in the first ten months of 2025. This analysis examines the restructuring of HQ's import dependencies, the growing reliance on expensive U.S. electricity, and the critical role of Churchill Falls in Quebec's energy security.

THE ROLE OF CHURCHILL FALLS IMPORTS IN QUEBEC'S ELECTRICITY PICTURE

Churchill Falls electricity is a necessary "import" to Hydro-Québec. It guarantees Quebec a long-term, secure, and extremely cheap source of electricity to meet its own domestic needs and to profitably export electricity to New Brunswick and particularly to the USA.

As such, Churchill Falls electricity enables HQ to provide Quebec households and businesses with the cheapest power in Canada and the G7, which include the USA.

Some would say that Newfoundland and Labrador "subsidizes" Quebec's low electricity prices.

The key to Churchill Falls electricity's low price is the almost free cost of the vast water resources of the Churchill River.

As the former Government of Newfoundland and Labrador wrote in its "Our Chapter," it hopes the MOU will unlock the "value" of Churchill Falls.

HQ'S IMPORT PICTURE: 2022 & EARLIER

In 2022, 14.0% of the electricity available to Quebec came from imports.

- 13.7% of the available power came from other provinces, some from Ontario but the vast majority from Churchill Falls
- 0.3% came from the USA

Before 2022, HQ rarely imported power from the USA.

THE AMAZING RESTRUCTURING OF HQ'S IMPORT PICTURE: 2024 & 2025

In the first ten months of 2025, total imports were up 3.5% from the same period last year.

Imports from other provinces were down 13.3% during this period. It is not clear why this is occurring since most of this imported power likely comes from Churchill Falls. This power is absolutely and relatively cheaper than power from elsewhere, so why the decline when total imports increased?

In 2024, 17.4% of the electricity available to Quebec came from imports.
- 15.7% of the available power came from other provinces
- An approximate estimation is that about 31.5 TWh of electricity imported into Quebec in 2024 came from Churchill Falls. This represented about 80.6% of the total imported power.
- 1.7% came from the USA

KEY FINDING: SURGE IN U.S. IMPORTS

In the first ten months of 2025, imports from the USA were up 128.9%!

During this period, imports from the USA were greater than exports by 38.8%. Traditionally, exports to the USA are greater than imports. This is an amazing change in electricity trading patterns with the USA.

HYDRO-QUEBEC'S IMPORTS FROM THE USA AND OTHER PROVINCES
January 2015 - October 2025

The data visualization shows two distinct patterns:

1. HQ Imports from other provinces (dominated by Churchill Falls): Relatively stable at 3-4.5 million MWh per month throughout the entire period, with some seasonal variation.

2. Imports from the USA: Minimal (near zero) from 2015 through 2022, then beginning to increase in 2023, with dramatic spikes in 2024-2025 reaching levels comparable to interprovincial imports.

This represents a fundamental restructuring of Quebec's electricity supply security.

IMPORTS FROM VERMONT AND NEW YORK STATE

The chart illustrates the remarkable changes in import patterns. Imports from New York started to play a continuing and more significant role in 2023. Imports from Vermont came into the picture in late 2024 and increasingly in the second half of 2025.

The nature of the imports is changing rapidly after many years of the picture being constant. It is hard to predict what 2026 and beyond will look like.

For Hydro-Quebec, security of supply may not be there since it is entering competitive and dynamic U.S. markets.

HYDRO-QUÉBEC'S MONTHLY IMPORTS FROM NEW YORK STATE AND VERMONT
January 2022 - November 2025

The data show:

New York State imports: Beginning in mid-2023, gradually increasing through 2024, with significant volumes (400,000-600,000 MWh) in 2025.

Vermont imports: Sporadic through 2024, then becoming more consistent and substantial in 2025, with some months exceeding 800,000 MWh.

This diversification into multiple U.S. sources represents both an opportunity and a vulnerability for Quebec's energy security.

US IMPORT PRICES PAID BY HYDRO-QUÉBEC (CANADIAN DOLLARS)

The chart should be used with caution. Prices (Canadian dollars) in 2022 reflect the inflationary forces in play after the pandemic of 2020-21.

Electricity production in these U.S. states began to use more natural gas in electricity production and these gas prices began to fall in 2023.

The cost of gas plays a significant role in explaining the price of electricity. Water is relatively very cheap and explains why hydroelectricity is relatively so cheap.

Electricity prices will rise in the winter months as household demand increases and gas production and transmission is affected by cold weather.

HYDRO-QUEBEC'S IMPORT PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY FROM NEW YORK STATE AND VERMONT

The data show significant price volatility:

New York to HQ prices: Peaked at approximately $350/MWh (35¢/kWh) in early 2022, fell to around $50/MWh (5¢/kWh) in 2023, then showed considerable volatility through 2024-2025, ranging from $50-150/MWh.

Vermont to HQ prices: Data available primarily for 2024-2025, showing similar volatility patterns to New York, ranging from approximately $50-200/MWh.

These prices are dramatically higher than Churchill Falls electricity, which costs HQ less than 0.5¢/kWh under the current 1969 contract.

COMPARATIVE COST ANALYSIS

First Quarter 2025:
- Price of imported power from NY into Quebec: 10.25¢/kWh

Second Quarter 2025:
- Price of imported power from NY into Quebec: 5.04¢/kWh

Year to date (through September 2025):
- Price of imported power from NY into Quebec: 7.15¢/kWh

For context, Churchill Falls power costs HQ approximately 0.4¢/kWh, making U.S. imports roughly 18-25 times more expensive than Churchill Falls electricity.

SUMMARY: THE STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

There is a growing dependency in Quebec on imported power, particularly relatively expensive electricity (about 25 times more expensive than Churchill Falls electricity) from the USA.

The changing picture is a remarkable change from the historic picture.

The future picture is unfolding but it puts Québec in a very difficult position if it continues.

Over the past decade Quebec has entered into agreements with its traditional trading partners and made infrastructure investments assuming its export of green low-cost electricity would continue. Instead, the electricity is flowing into Quebec and not from it!

Churchill Falls, with its super cheap power, has reached its generating capacity and cannot export more power to Quebec.

CRITICAL QUESTION: Does Hydro-Québec have a long-term problem?

The evidence suggests:

1. Declining domestic hydroelectric production due to drought
2. Growing domestic demand
3. Shrinking export capacity and revenue
4. Increasing dependence on expensive U.S. imports
5. Maximum utilization of Churchill Falls (no room for expansion under current contract)
6. Major infrastructure investments made assuming continued export growth

All of these factors point to a structural challenge for HQ that may require:
- New generation capacity
- Revised trading relationships
- Potential renegotiation of the Churchill Falls contract (as contemplated in the December 2024 MOU)
- Alternative supply strategies

The 2041 expiration of the Churchill Falls contract becomes even more critical in this context, as HQ faces the prospect of losing its cheapest, most reliable power source precisely when it may need it most.
