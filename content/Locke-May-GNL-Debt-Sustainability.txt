NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR DEBT, FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND THE CHURCHILL FALLS MOU
Source: Presentation by Wade Locke and Doug May to the Atlantic Association of Applied Economists (Canadian Association of Business Economics), St. John's, April 15, 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Newfoundland and Labrador faces a unique fiscal challenge: it has the highest per capita revenues, expenditures, debt, and debt servicing costs of any Canadian province. Since the oil transformation period (2006-2012), the province has run consistent deficits, accumulating a net debt of $19.4B ($32,782 per capita vs. national average of $21,000).
The Churchill Falls MOU presents a significant opportunity for fiscal stabilization. With projected average annual revenues of $2.5B from existing Churchill Falls power over the next 50 years, the province could allocate $500M annually for 30 years to reduce per capita debt to the national average.
However, demographic pressures (oldest population in Canada, 32.4% projected to be over 65 by 2049) will continue to strain healthcare spending and limit revenue growth potential.
CURRENT FISCAL STATE
KEY FISCAL INDICATORS (2023-24)
Indicator	NL Value	National Average	NL Rank
Revenue per capita	~$19,000	~$14,000	Highest
Expenditure per capita	~$19,000	~$14,000	Highest
Net debt per capita	$32,782	$20,973	Highest
Debt charges per capita	~$2,100	~$850	Highest
BUDGET 2025 SNAPSHOT
� Net Debt: $19.4 billion 
� Projected Deficit: $372 million 
� Government Position: "It was not the year for us to force going back to balance this year" - Minister Siobhan Coady 
CRITICAL OBSERVATION: NL is a fiscal enigma - simultaneously having the highest revenues AND highest debt among provinces.
HISTORICAL CONTEXT
DEFICIT PATTERN SINCE 2006
Since the oil transformation period (2006-2012), the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has run persistent deficits:
Revenue vs. Expenditure Trend (2007-2023):
� 2007: Revenues exceeded expenditures during oil boom 
� 2008-2012: Surplus period driven by high oil prices 
� 2013-present: Consistent deficits with expenditures exceeding revenues 
� Gap has widened significantly since 2015 
FEDERAL VS. PROVINCIAL FISCAL BALANCE IN NL (2007-2023)
Period	Federal Balance in NL	GNL Balance
2007-2012	Moderate surplus	Strong surplus
2013-2015	Increasing deficit	Growing deficit
2016-2020	Large deficit	Large deficit
2021-2023	Deficit declining	Persistent deficit
Note: Rising federal net expenditures have partially supported the provincial economy through transfers to individuals, promoting household expenditures.
COMPARATIVE PROVINCIAL ANALYSIS
REVENUE PER CAPITA COMPARISON
NL has maintained the highest per capita provincial revenues since the early 2000s:
Historical Revenue Per Capita (Selected Years):
� 1994-95: NL ~$6,500  |  Canada ~$6,000 
� 2007-08: NL ~$12,000  |  Canada ~$8,000 (oil boom peak) 
� 2015-16: NL ~$11,000  |  Canada ~$9,000 
� 2023-24: NL ~$19,000  |  Canada ~$14,000 
NL's revenues per capita exceed even Alberta's, making the debt situation more paradoxical.
EXPENDITURE PER CAPITA COMPARISON
Expenditure patterns mirror revenue patterns:
Historical Expenditure Per Capita (Selected Years):
� 1994-95: NL ~$7,000  |  Canada ~$6,500 
� 2007-08: NL ~$10,000  |  Canada ~$8,500 
� 2015-16: NL ~$12,000  |  Canada ~$9,500 
� 2023-24: NL ~$19,000  |  Canada ~$14,000 
Main expenditure categories: Healthcare and education Outcome paradox: Despite highest per capita spending, NL has the lowest outcomes in healthcare and education among Canadian provinces.
NET DEBT PER CAPITA BY PROVINCE (2023-24)
Province	Debt Per Capita
Alberta	$8,830
Saskatchewan	$11,864
British Columbia	$12,882
New Brunswick	$14,214
Prince Edward Island	$15,242
Nova Scotia	$17,526
Manitoba	$22,214
Quebec	$24,866
Ontario	$26,113
Newfoundland & Labrador	$32,782
Canada Average	$20,973
NL's per capita debt is 56% higher than the national average.
DEBT BURDEN DETAILS
THE HARBINGERS OF DEBT PROBLEMS
A. Credit Ratings
Average Credit Rating by Bond Rating Agencies (out of 30 points):
Province	Rating Score
British Columbia	27
Saskatchewan	23
Alberta	22
Ontario	21
Quebec	20
New Brunswick	20
Nova Scotia	20
Manitoba	19
Prince Edward Island	17
Newfoundland & Labrador	15
KEY FACT: NL has the lowest credit rating of any province, which directly impacts borrowing costs.
B. Borrowing Costs
Relationship Between Credit Rating and Borrowing Rate:
� Lower credit ratings result in higher interest rates 
� NL pays premium rates compared to higher-rated provinces 
� Correlation formula: y = 0.0001x + 0.0389 (R� = 0.6048) 
Provincial Borrowing Rates (10-year bonds, Sept 2024):
� British Columbia: ~3.58% 
� Alberta/Saskatchewan: ~3.59% 
� Ontario/Quebec: ~3.60% 
� New Brunswick/Nova Scotia/Manitoba: ~3.62-3.64% 
� Prince Edward Island: ~3.68% 
� Newfoundland & Labrador: ~3.72% 
C. Interest Rate Trends
Weighted-Average Interest Rate for NL Debentures:
Period	Interest Rate
1985	12.31%
1990-2000	Declining from ~8% to ~6%
2005	4.60%
2020	3.33%
2024	6.67%
2024-2027 projection	3.50%-4.60%
CRITICAL POINT: Interest rates have declined dramatically from historical highs but are now rising again, making rollover of debt more costly.
D. Outstanding Debt to Mature
As of 2025-26, there is $20B in outstanding debentures:
Average NL Outstanding Debt by Five-Year Periods:
Period	Amount ($ millions)
1981-1985	$179
1986-1990	$3,825
1991-1995	$5,026
1996-2000	$5,835
2001-2005	$5,909
2006-2010	$5,460
2011-2015	$13,231
2016-2020	$17,855
2021-2025	$19,071
2026-2030	$11,179
2031-2035	$9,498
2036-2040	$8,550
2041-2045	$6,270
2046-2050	$2,250
2051-2055	$0
E. Debt Coming Due
NL Outstanding Debt Due to Mature by Five-Year Periods:
Period	Amount ($ millions)	Average/Year ($ billions)
2026-2030	$7,100	$1.4
2031-2035	$5,200	$1.0
2036-2040	$900	$0.2
2041-2045	$3,400	$0.7
2046-2050	$900	$0.2
2051-2055	$4,150	$0.8
2056-2060	$900	$0.2
In next 10 years: $12.3B in debt coming due ($1.5B per year average)
� 2026-30: $7.1B ($1.4B per year) 
� 2031-35: $5.2B ($1.0B per year) 
MAJOR CONCERN: Large amounts of debt must be refinanced at potentially higher interest rates.
DEBT CHARGES PER CAPITA TREND
Debt Charges Per Capita - NL vs. Canada (1995-2024):
Year	NL Debt Charge PC	Canada Debt Charge PC
1995-96	~$1,700	~$750
2000-01	~$1,850	~$850
2007-08	~$1,500	~$750
2012-13	~$1,600	~$700
2015-16	~$1,650	~$800
2019-20	~$1,850	~$800
2023-24	~$2,100	~$850
NL's debt servicing costs are approximately 2.5 times the national average.
DEBT REDUCTION CALCULATION
PATH TO NATIONAL AVERAGE DEBT
Current Situation:
� All-province per capita debt: ~$21,000 
� NL per capita debt: $35,896 ($19.45B � 541,820 people) 
� Gap to close: $14,896 per capita 
Total Debt Reduction Required: $8.1 billion
Debt Reduction Strategy:
� Timeline: 30-40 years 
� Assumed interest rate: 4.6% (provincial borrowing cost) 
� Annual payment required: $500 million for 30 years 
� Total investment needed: $11.4 billion to eliminate $8.1 billion in debt (accounting for interest) 
Target Result: Reduce NL debt to $11.4B total, or $21,000 per capita (matching national average)

? Calculation: 5.9 cents/kWh 
? Method: Average the present values of forecasted prices 
APVP (Average Present Value of Prices) - Wade Locke's method 
? Calculation: 2.64 cents/kWh 
? Method: Present value of average forecasted prices 
? This is the relevant economic measure

DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES
AGING POPULATION TRENDS
Since Confederation (1949):
� NL has gone from the youngest median age to the oldest median age in Canada 
� NL now has the highest proportion of population over 65 years of age 
FUTURE DEMOGRAPHIC PROJECTIONS (2049)
Population Over 65 Years of Age:
� Newfoundland & Labrador: 32.4% 
� Canada: 23.6% 
Based on Statistics Canada M6 forecast scenario
HEALTHCARE COST IMPLICATIONS
� Per capita healthcare costs are already the highest in Canada 
� Aging population will drive healthcare costs even higher 
� With reduced working-age population, revenue generation capacity will decline 
� Same tax rates applied to older, smaller workforce = lower total revenues 
FISCAL PRESSURE SUMMARY
Increasing Pressures:
Rising healthcare costs (aging population) 
Declining revenue potential (shrinking workforce) 
High existing debt servicing costs 
Large debt refinancing requirements 
Limited Flexibility:
� Already highest income tax rates in Canada 
� Limited room to increase taxes further 
� Expenditure outcomes (health, education) already poorest despite highest spending 
HISTORICAL SURPLUS CONTEXT
RARE FISCAL SURPLUSES SINCE 1949
Since joining Canada in 1949, NL has achieved only 10 fiscal surpluses:
6 surpluses due to oil revenues:
� Peak period: 2006-2012 
� High oil prices drove temporary surpluses 
4 surpluses due to federal transfers:
� Various federal payment agreements 
� Example: 2019 Accord payments 
KEY OBSERVATION: Structural deficits are the norm; surpluses require extraordinary circumstances (resource booms or federal bailouts)
THE FISCAL ENIGMA EXPLAINED
WHY NL IS A FISCAL PARADOX
Simultaneous Extremes:
Highest revenues per capita - More money coming in than any other province 
Highest expenditures per capita - Spending more per person than any other province 
Highest debt per capita - Owing more per person than any other province 
Highest debt servicing costs per capita - Paying more interest per person than any other province 
Yet Also:
� Lowest healthcare outcomes despite highest healthcare spending 
� Lowest education outcomes despite high education spending 
THE SPENDING-OUTCOME DISCONNECT
Main Expenditure Categories:
Healthcare 
Education 
Evidence on outcomes:
� Healthcare performance metrics: Lowest among Canadian provinces 
� Education performance metrics: Lowest among Canadian provinces 
The paradox: Highest input (spending) ? Lowest output (results)
POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS
Quote from Minister Siobhan Coady (Budget 2025):
"In the global economic chaos caused by tariffs and changing alliances, we will be calm, strategic, steadfast, and determined. Always remember that superb sailors are made by turbulent seas."
Also stated:
"It was not the year for us to force going back to balance this year. Every year it is a balance of where we are with the economy."
Perpetual Theme: "In balancing the budget and ensuring fiscal stability, if this is not the year, then we can always hope and plan for next year or the following year or the year after that."
Cultural Pattern Since Confederation:
� Political culture of incurring provincial government deficits 
� Persistent hope that "next year" will be different 
� Lack of sustained commitment to fiscal balance 
� Limited political or electoral concern about debt levels 
KEY TAKEAWAYS
THE THREE MAIN CONCLUSIONS
HISTORICAL LACK OF FISCAL STABILITY
� Historically and into the present, there has generally been a lack of success in achieving fiscal stability 
� Pattern of deficits since Confederation, with only brief interruptions 
� Cultural and political acceptance of deficit financing 
NL IS A FISCAL ENIGMA
� Unique combination of highest revenues AND highest debt 
� Spending more but achieving less than other provinces 
� Paradoxical situation not seen in any other Canadian jurisdiction 
CHURCHILL FALLS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY
� Using existing power from CF with proposed new rate structure 
� Opportunity to reduce provincial government debt per capita to Canadian average 
� Requires discipline to allocate $500M annually for 30 years 
� Total CF revenues could support this while maintaining services 
CRITICAL CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS
What Must Happen:
Political Will: Commitment to debt reduction over multiple election cycles 
Fiscal Discipline: Actual allocation of $500M/year to debt retirement 
Revenue Protection: Ensuring CF revenues flow to debt reduction, not new spending 
Demographic Management: Containing healthcare cost growth despite aging population 
What Could Derail Success:
Political pressure to spend CF revenues on programs instead of debt 
Economic shocks requiring deficit spending 
Higher-than-expected interest rates on debt refinancing 
Faster-than-projected healthcare cost increases 
THE STAKES
If NL Succeeds:
� Debt per capita reduced to national average by 2055 
� Lower borrowing costs due to improved credit rating 
� Reduced vulnerability to interest rate increases 
� More fiscal flexibility for future challenges 
� Breaking the cycle of perpetual deficits 
If NL Fails:
� Continued highest debt burden in Canada 
� Increasing debt servicing costs 
� Potential credit rating downgrades 
� Reduced capacity to respond to crises 
� Intergenerational burden on shrinking population 
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
INFORMATION NOT YET PUBLIC
CF Extension Pricing: 
? What will power from the upgraded/enlarged Churchill Falls facility cost? 
? Revenue projections not disclosed 
Gull Island Pricing: 
? What will power from new Gull Island facility cost? 
? Financial analysis not available 
Price Escalation Details: 
? Specific methodology for price increases over time 
? Trigger mechanisms and formulas 
Total Project Costs: 
? Capital costs for CF upgrades 
? Capital costs for Gull Island development 
? Transmission infrastructure investments 
Risk Allocation: 
? How are construction cost overruns handled? 
? What happens if projected power prices don't materialize? 
? Environmental or regulatory delays 
CRITICAL ANALYSIS NEEDED
Questions for Further Investigation:
Why do highest expenditures produce lowest outcomes? 
? System inefficiencies? 
? Geographic challenges and costs? 
? Management and governance issues? 
? Demographic factors? 
Is $500M/year politically feasible? 
? Historical spending patterns suggest challenges 
? Electoral pressures for program spending 
? Multi-decade commitment required 
What if CF revenues are lower than projected? 
? Sensitivity analysis needed 
? Alternative scenarios 
? Contingency plans 
Can healthcare costs be contained? 
? Given aging demographics 
? International best practices 
? System reform requirements 

CONCLUSION
Newfoundland and Labrador stands at a fiscal crossroads. The province's unique position as having both the highest revenues and highest debt per capita in Canada reflects decades of spending patterns that have not been matched by fiscal discipline or outcomes.
The Churchill Falls MOU represents a potentially transformative opportunity�projected revenues of approximately $2.5B annually over 50 years could enable systematic debt reduction while maintaining services. However, success requires breaking from historical patterns of deficit financing and demonstrating sustained political will to allocate $500M annually to debt retirement for 30 years.
The demographic reality�becoming Canada's oldest population by 2049�will place additional strain on healthcare spending and reduce revenue-generation capacity. This makes the current opportunity even more critical: the province must address its debt burden now, while CF revenues provide the means, before demographic pressures make the challenge even more difficult.
The question remains: Will the political culture that has historically accepted deficits embrace the discipline required for fiscal sustainability? The answer will determine whether NL can transform its fiscal trajectory or continue its pattern of perpetual hope for "next year."
