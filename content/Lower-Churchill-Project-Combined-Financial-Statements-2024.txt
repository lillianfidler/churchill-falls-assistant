We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards ("Canadian GAAS"). We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
