Context: Analysis following "The Role Of Churchill Falls Import in Quebec's Electricity Picture (Video 3-A)"

====================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================

This analysis documents a remarkable transformation in Hydro-Québec's electricity import patterns between 2022 and 2025. Historically, Hydro-Québec relied almost exclusively on Churchill Falls (Labrador) for imported power. However, data through October 2025 reveals:

- Total imports increased by 3.5% in first ten months of 2025 vs 2024
- Imports from other provinces (primarily Churchill Falls) DECREASED by 13.3% during same period
- Imports from USA increased by 128.9% in first ten months of 2025
- For first time in Quebec's history, imports from USA (Jan-Oct 2025) exceeded exports by 38.8%

This represents an "amazing restructuring" that puts Quebec in a difficult position, importing expensive US electricity while reducing reliance on cheap Churchill Falls power.

====================
HISTORICAL CONTEXT: THE ROLE OF CHURCHILL FALLS (Pre-2022)
====================

CHURCHILL FALLS AS NECESSARY IMPORT:

Churchill Falls electricity represents a critical import to Hydro-Québec that:
1. Guarantees Quebec a long-term, secure source of electricity
2. Provides extremely cheap power to meet domestic needs
3. Enables profitable electricity exports to New Brunswick and USA
4. Allows HQ to provide Quebec households and businesses with cheapest power in Canada and G7

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Some analysts say Newfoundland and Labrador "subsidizes" Quebec's low electricity prices
- The key to CF electricity's low price is the almost free cost of vast Churchill River water resources
- Former Government of Newfoundland and Labrador stated in "Our Chapter" document that it hopes the MOU will unlock the "value" of Churchill Falls

====================
2022 IMPORT PICTURE (BASELINE)
====================

TOTAL IMPORTS: 14.0% of electricity available to Quebec

BREAKDOWN:
- Imports from other provinces: 13.7% of total available power
  * Vast majority from Churchill Falls (Labrador)
  * Small amount from Ontario
- Imports from USA: 0.3% of total available power

HISTORICAL PATTERN:
Before 2022, Hydro-Québec rarely imported power from the USA. The import picture was stable and consistent for many years.

====================
2024 IMPORT PICTURE (TRANSFORMATION BEGINS)
====================

TOTAL IMPORTS: 17.4% of electricity available to Quebec (increase from 14.0%)

BREAKDOWN:
- Imports from other provinces: 15.7% of total available power
  * Estimated 31.5 TWh from Churchill Falls
  * This represented approximately 80.6% of total imported power
- Imports from USA: 1.7% of total available power (dramatic increase from 0.3%)

ANALYSIS QUESTION:
Author notes it is "not clear" why imports from other provinces would decline when total imports increased, given that Churchill Falls power is "absolutely and relatively cheaper than power from elsewhere."

====================
2025 IMPORT PICTURE (REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION)
====================

FIRST TEN MONTHS 2025 (January-October):

TOTAL IMPORTS: Up 3.5% from same period 2024

PROVINCIAL IMPORTS: Down 13.3% from same period 2024
- Unexplained decline in Churchill Falls imports despite being cheapest available source
- Author questions: "why the decline when total imports increased?"

USA IMPORTS: Up 128.9% from same period 2024

UNPRECEDENTED TRADE REVERSAL:
- Imports from USA EXCEEDED exports to USA by 38.8%
- This is described as "amazing change in electricity trading patterns with the USA"
- Traditionally, exports to USA are always greater than imports
- Complete reversal of historical trade relationship

====================
USA IMPORT SOURCES: NEW YORK STATE AND VERMONT
====================

CHANGING IMPORT PATTERNS:

NEW YORK STATE:
- Imports start to play "continuing and more significant role" beginning in 2023
- Steady increase through 2024 and 2025
- Monthly imports ranging from near-zero to over 800,000 MWh in 2025

VERMONT:
- Enters the import picture in late 2024
- Increasingly significant in second half of 2025
- Monthly imports reaching 200,000-400,000 MWh range

TIME SERIES DATA (Monthly patterns visible in chart):
- January 2022 - December 2022: Minimal USA imports
- January 2023 - December 2023: New York imports begin to appear regularly
- January 2024 - December 2024: Both New York and Vermont imports increase
- January 2025 - November 2025: Dramatic acceleration of USA imports from both states

AUTHOR'S ASSESSMENT:
"The nature of the imports is changing rapidly after many years of the picture being constant. It is hard to predict what 2026 and beyond will look like."

====================
USA IMPORT PRICING ANALYSIS
====================

PRICE TRENDS (Canadian Dollars per MWh):

Author caution: "The chart should be used with caution."

2022 PRICES:
- Reflect inflationary forces after 2020-21 pandemic
- Peak prices approaching $350-400 CAD/MWh in some months
- High natural gas prices driving electricity costs

2023-2024 PRICE DECLINE:
- Natural gas prices began to fall in 2023
- Electricity production in US states increased use of natural gas
- Prices generally lower than 2022 peak

SEASONAL PATTERNS:
- Electricity prices rise in winter months
- Driven by increased household demand
- Gas production and transmission affected by cold weather

FUNDAMENTAL PRICE DRIVER:
"The cost of gas plays a significant role in explaining the price of electricity. Water is relatively very cheap and explains why hydroelectricity is relatively so cheap."

PRICE COMPARISON (Q1 and Q2 2025):

First Quarter 2025:
- Price of imported power from NY into Quebec: 10.25¢ per kWh

Second Quarter 2025:
- Price of imported power from NY into Quebec: 5.04¢ per kWh

To date (through September 2025):
- Average price of imported power from NY: 7.15¢ per kWh

CONTEXT:
- USA electricity is approximately 25 times more expensive than Churchill Falls electricity
- This makes the import pattern shift economically troubling for Quebec

====================
SECURITY OF SUPPLY CONCERNS
====================

AUTHOR'S ASSESSMENT:

"For Hydro-Quebec security of supply may not be there since it is entering competitive and dynamic U.S. markets."

KEY CONCERNS:

1. MARKET VOLATILITY:
- USA electricity markets are competitive and dynamic
- Prices fluctuate based on natural gas costs, weather, demand
- Not the guaranteed, stable supply that Churchill Falls provides

2. LOSS OF GUARANTEED SUPPLY:
- Churchill Falls provides long-term contractual certainty
- USA markets offer no such guarantees
- Quebec now dependent on market conditions beyond its control

3. PRICE EXPOSURE:
- Subject to USA natural gas price volatility
- Seasonal price spikes during winter
- No protection from supply disruptions

4. STRATEGIC VULNERABILITY:
- Reduced energy security compared to provincial sources
- Dependent on international market dynamics
- Potential for supply interruptions

====================
THE CHURCHILL FALLS CAPACITY CONSTRAINT
====================

CRITICAL LIMITATION:

"Churchill Falls, with its super cheap power, has reached its generating capacity and cannot export more power to Quebec."

IMPLICATIONS:

1. MAXIMUM CAPACITY REACHED:
- Churchill Falls cannot increase exports to Quebec
- This is the primary constraint forcing Quebec into USA markets
- No ability to substitute cheap CF power for expensive USA imports

2. INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITS:
- Existing transmission capacity fully utilized
- Generation facilities operating at maximum output
- No short-term solutions available

3. STRATEGIC BIND:
- Quebec cannot access more cheap Churchill Falls power
- Must turn to expensive USA imports to meet demand
- Caught between capacity constraint and growing electricity needs

====================
HISTORICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND EXPORT COMMITMENTS
====================

AUTHOR'S ASSESSMENT:

"Over the past decade Quebec has entered into agreements with its traditional trading partners and made infrastructure investments assuming its export of green low-cost electricity would continue. Instead, the electricity is flowing into Quebec and not from it!"

IMPLICATIONS:

1. STRANDED INVESTMENTS:
- Infrastructure built for export business model
- Now being used for imports instead
- Economic returns not materializing as planned

2. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS:
- Export agreements with traditional partners
- Based on assumption of surplus Quebec generation
- May be difficult to fulfill given import dependency

3. STRATEGIC MISCALCULATION:
- Business model assumed continued export capacity
- Reality shows import dependency
- Complete reversal of anticipated trade flows

====================
AUTHOR'S SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
====================

"There is a growing dependency in Quebec on imported power, particularly relatively expensive electricity (about 25 times more expensive than CF electricity) from the USA."

KEY FINDINGS:

1. REMARKABLE CHANGE:
"The changing picture is a remarkable change from the historic picture."

2. UNCERTAINTY:
"The future picture is unfolding but it puts Québec in a very difficult position if it continues."

3. BUSINESS MODEL INVERSION:
"Over the past decade Quebec has entered into agreements with its traditional trading partners and made infrastructure investments assuming its export of green low-cost electricity would continue. Instead, the electricity is flowing into Quebec and not from it!"

4. CAPACITY CONSTRAINT:
"Churchill Falls, with its super cheap power, has reached its generating capacity and cannot export more power to Quebec."

5. LONG-TERM PROBLEM:
"Does Hydro-Québec have a long-term problem?"

====================
CRITICAL ANALYSIS POINTS
====================

UNEXPLAINED PARADOX:

The analysis highlights a puzzling contradiction:
- Total imports increased 3.5% (Jan-Oct 2025 vs 2024)
- Provincial imports (primarily Churchill Falls) decreased 13.3%
- Churchill Falls is the cheapest source available
- Economic logic suggests maximizing Churchill Falls imports
- Yet Quebec is reducing cheap imports while increasing expensive USA imports

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS (not provided in document but implied):
- Churchill Falls may have operational or transmission constraints
- Contract limitations may restrict additional CF volumes
- Water/reservoir management issues at Churchill Falls
- Political considerations in import sourcing
- Diversification strategy to reduce dependency

SECURITY OF SUPPLY SHIFT:

Historical Model:
- Secure, guaranteed supply from Churchill Falls
- Long-term contractual certainty
- Extremely low, stable pricing
- Provincial control

New Model:
- Competitive USA electricity markets
- No supply guarantees
- Price volatility linked to natural gas
- Subject to international market forces
- Reduced energy security

====================
IMPLICATIONS FOR QUEBEC
====================

ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS:

1. COST STRUCTURE:
- Import costs increasing approximately 25-fold (CF vs USA power)
- This cost increase must be absorbed or passed to ratepayers
- Threatens Quebec's position as having lowest electricity costs in G7

2. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
- Quebec's cheap electricity is economic development tool
- Attracts energy-intensive industries
- Higher import costs undermine this advantage

3. EXPORT ECONOMICS:
- Cannot profitably export expensive imported power
- Business model relies on cheap generation/imports for export margins
- Economic case for export infrastructure investments weakened

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:

1. ENERGY SECURITY:
- Reduced control over supply sources
- Vulnerability to USA market disruptions
- Weather-dependent supply from gas-fired generation

2. INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING:
- Past decade's investments assumed export model
- Need to reassess infrastructure strategy
- May require new investments for import capacity

3. POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Dependency on USA electricity markets
- Reduced leverage in Churchill Falls/NL negotiations
- Cross-border energy relationships more critical

====================
METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
====================

AUTHOR'S CAVEATS:

On Price Data:
"The chart should be used with caution. Prices (Canadian dollars) in 2022 reflect the inflationary forces in play after the pandemic of 2020-21."

On Future Predictions:
"The nature of the imports is changing rapidly after many years of the picture being constant. It is hard to predict what 2026 and beyond will look like."

On Data Interpretation:
Author acknowledges uncertainty: "It is not clear to me why this is occurring since, I believe, most of this imported power likely comes from Churchill Falls."

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:

The analysis uses:
- Comparative time series (2022, 2024, 2025)
- Month-by-month granular data
- Percentage change calculations
- Historical baseline comparisons
- Visual chart analysis

====================
PRICING CONTEXT: CHURCHILL FALLS VS USA
====================

IMPLIED PRICING COMPARISON:

USA Import Prices (2025 average): approximately 7.15¢/kWh
Implied Churchill Falls Price: approximately 0.28¢/kWh (based on "25 times cheaper" statement)

This dramatic price differential (approximately 2,550% difference) explains:
- Why Churchill Falls has been foundation of Quebec's low electricity costs
- Why shift to USA imports is economically problematic
- Why Quebec's competitive advantage is at risk
- Why this represents a "very difficult position"

COST CALCULATION EXAMPLE:

If Quebec imports 1,000 GWh:
- From Churchill Falls: approximately $2.8 million
- From USA (at 2025 rates): approximately $71.5 million
- Additional cost: approximately $68.7 million

This illustrates the economic magnitude of the import pattern shift.

====================
QUESTIONS RAISED
====================

The analysis raises several unresolved questions:

1. "Why the decline when total imports increased?"
   - Why reduce cheap Churchill Falls imports while increasing expensive USA imports?

2. "It is not clear to me why this is occurring..."
   - What operational or strategic factors explain the provincial import reduction?

3. "Does Hydro-Québec have a long-term problem?"
   - Is this temporary or structural challenge?

4. Implied: What will 2026 and beyond look like?
   - Will current trends continue?
   - Can Quebec reverse the import dependency?

5. Implied: How will this affect Quebec electricity rates?
   - Can current low rates be sustained with expensive imports?

====================
CONNECTION TO CHURCHILL FALLS MOU
====================

CONTEXT REFERENCE:

Author notes that Newfoundland and Labrador's "Our Chapter" document "hopes the MOU will unlock the 'value' of Churchill Falls."

IMPLICATIONS:

1. CURRENT AGREEMENT:
- Churchill Falls exports to Quebec at extremely low prices
- Based on 1969 contract terms
- This cheap power has reached capacity limits

2. MOU SIGNIFICANCE:
- Could potentially change pricing structure
- Might affect future import volumes
- Could impact Quebec's electricity cost structure

3. TIMING RELEVANCE:
- Quebec becoming more dependent on expensive USA imports
- At same time discussions ongoing about Churchill Falls future
- Quebec's negotiating position affected by import dependency

====================
CONCLUSION
====================

This analysis documents an unprecedented transformation in Quebec's electricity import patterns. The province that historically relied almost exclusively on cheap, secure Churchill Falls power is now rapidly increasing expensive imports from competitive USA markets while simultaneously reducing provincial imports.

The shift raises fundamental questions about:
- Energy security for Quebec
- Economic sustainability of current import patterns
- Future of Quebec's low electricity cost advantage
- Strategic planning for electricity infrastructure
- Long-term electricity supply strategy

As the author concludes: "Does Hydro-Québec have a long-term problem?"

The data through October 2025 suggests the answer may be yes, unless the current trajectory changes or new sources of low-cost supply can be secured.
