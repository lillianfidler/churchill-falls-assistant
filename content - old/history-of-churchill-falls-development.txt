Introduction

In September 2007, the government of Danny Williams released its much anticipated Focusing
Our Energy: An Energy Plan for Newfoundland and Labrador. The plan expressed great
optimism for the future and argued that the province was at a watershed; it had faced challenges
in the past that had taught some hard lessons, but the lessons had been learned and the province
was now potentially on the cusp of sustained prosperity. It was clear that the province's future
prosperity was to be anchored on natural resource development that included exploiting a wide
range of non-renewable and renewable energy sources including existing and new hydroelectric
developments in Labrador. The key to achieving that prosperity was to have a flexible strategy
with contingencies in place to mitigate, as far as possible, the vagaries of resource development,
jurisdictional politics, and emerging opportunities resulting from global struggles to combat
climate change.1

Focusing Our Energy also illustrated the persistence of a key fact that had frustrated successive
provincial governments from the time of Confederation with Canada to Premier Williams. The
vast hydroelectric resources in Labrador were isolated from the lucrative North American energy
markets. That basic fact was exacerbated by the additional fact that the province had perpetually
struggled to overcome various obstacles – technical, economic and political – and had never
been able to find a permanent solution to facilitate the full development of the hydroelectric
resources available on the Churchill River.

This report tells the story of the Province's attempts to develop the hydroelectric potential of the
Churchill River* from 1949 to 2007. The report begins with an overview of the immense
hydroelectric potential in Labrador at the Upper Churchill site and the two Lower Churchill sites
at Muskrat Falls and Gull Island. It then explains the significance of the 1927 decision by the
highest court in the British Empire, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) that
determined that Newfoundland had jurisdiction over a vast inland territory that included the
Churchill River watershed. The paper is then divided into time frames associated with the
various Newfoundland and Labrador premiers and their respective attempts to facilitate
hydroelectric development in Labrador. The final section of this paper discusses how promising
developments in the early 2000s were still insufficient to significantly strengthen Newfoundland
and Labrador's relative negotiating position to gain market access and how that fact was
reflected in Focusing Our Energy.

This report provides an overview of key players and events; however, it does not go into
exhaustive details of all of those key events, or associated controversies. As a result Annex:
Additional Reading has been included to point to more in-depth analysis.

* The name Churchill River, Falls and Basin did not appear until 1965 when the Hamilton River, Falls and Basin
were renamed to honour recently deceased British Prime Minister W.S. Churchill. However, for the sake of clarity,
this essay will refer to Churchill River and Falls through out, except where Hamilton River and Falls are in a quoted
record.

Overview of the Churchill River Watershed

Deep in Labrador's vast interior, the 856 km long Churchill River, with its approximate 92,500
square kms watershed, has long been known for its immense hydroelectric potential.2
Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro estimated that if all of the River's twenty-three potential
hydroelectric sites were fully developed approximately 15,200 MW of power could be produced.
The largest single site at Churchill Falls is developed and produces 5,428 megawatts (MW) of
electricity. The largest two undeveloped sites, at Gull Island and Muskrat Falls, combined have a
potential energy output of 3,088 MW.3

Former Premier Joseph R. Smallwood first seriously entertained the idea of developing the
Churchill River in 1926. At the time, Newfoundland and Labrador was preparing its case for the
JCPC, claiming ownership of Labrador. During the pre-Confederation debates at the
Newfoundland National Convention from 1946 to 1948, it was evident that the economic
development of Labrador, including its hydro resources, remained of paramount importance to
Smallwood. In 1947, he led a delegation to Ottawa to discuss possible terms of union between
the two countries. Smallwood claimed that the most important aspect of the Canadian draft
proposed arrangements was Clause 22, the economic survey. This entailed a promise to conduct
a comprehensive economic survey of the potential of both the island and mainland portions of
what would be the new province. According to Smallwood, Newfoundland and Labrador on its
own could not afford such a lavish survey.4

While the story told in this report starts after Smallwood's successful campaign to secure
confederation with Canada in 1949, the following section discusses what happened two decades
before, which set the stage for hydroelectric development negotiations in the post-confederation
era. The above-mentioned JCPC case in 1926-27, where Newfoundland and Canada were
disputing the Labrador border, plays a critical part in the overall narrative.

The Importance of the 1927 Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
Labrador Border Decision

Newfoundland's claim to the Labrador dated back to 1763 when naval commander and
Governor, Thomas Graves, under a commission was ceded the island of Newfoundland and the
coast of Labrador. The 1763 proclamation ultimately guaranteed Newfoundland's successful
court case in 1927.5 However, the territory was in dispute between Canada and Newfoundland
for decades before it was appealed to the JCPC. The court case hinged on the definition of the
term 'coast'. Newfoundland argued that the term 'coast' referred to "the crest of the watershed
of the rivers flowing into the Atlantic Ocean."6 Newfoundland's argument was consistent with
international law at the time which defined sea-coast as "the whole territory drained by the rivers
which empty into its line". The Gold Coast and the Coromandel Coast were given as evidence to
support the definition.7

The Canadians contended that the Labrador coast referred to a strip of land extending a mile
back from the high water mark.8 The Canadian definition was rejected on two fronts. Testimony
from medical practitioner and publicist, Sir Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell,9 illustrated the inadequacy
of the one-mile limit. After years of medical and philanthropic service to the people on the


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 5
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

Labrador coast, Grenfell was considered to be an expert on the subject. He stated that the
Canadian definition of a mile was insufficient, as Labrador fishermen would travel anywhere
from three to five miles inland to get firewood.10 In addition, the proposed strip would have,
"[sealed] off the hinterland up to the watershed from all contact with the shore, from which
access would naturally [have been] sought". It was decided that the 1763 Proclamation most
likely did not intend for such a limited definition of the term 'coast'.11 In addition,
Newfoundland had a strong claim to the Hamilton Inlet as "considerable trade in fur... on the
shores of the Hamilton Inlet with the Indians in the interior," was facilitated by Newfoundland's
Governor. In contrast there was no evidence "of any exercise of a Canadian jurisdiction in any
part of the territory in dispute."12 Canadian claims to the Labrador territory did not appear on
any map until 1900.13

The final JCPC decision stipulated that,

the boundary between Canada and Newfoundland in the Labrador Peninsula is a line
drawn due north from the eastern boundary of the bay or harbour of Ance Sablon as far
as the fifty second degree of north latitude, and from thence westward along that
parallel until it reaches the Romaine river and its headwaters to their source and from
there due north to the crest of the watershed and northward along the crest of the
watershed of the rivers flowing to the Atlantic until it reaches Cape Chidley;14

Having jurisdiction over the Churchill River enabled Newfoundland to pursue hydroelectric
developments. However, Labrador is bound by the North Atlantic to the east and Quebec to the
south and west. As a result, Churchill River hydroelectric resources are isolated from the eastern
Canadian and American energy markets. Newfoundland's relatively small population and
industrial base meant that gaining access to those markets was a prerequisite to the economic
viability of potential projects. This geographic reality provided Quebec with a negotiating
advantage concerning potential Churchill River projects.

1949-1972 – Joseph Smallwood Era – BRINCO and the 1969 Contract

Concerted efforts directed towards the development of Labrador's vast hydroelectric potential
began in 1952. In that year, Smallwood, having failed to find sufficient interest in North
America, went to Great Britain to attempt to find backers to develop the Churchill River Basin.
Meetings with such influential British personalities as Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the
powerful Rothschilds banking family led to the formal creation of the British Newfoundland
Company (BRINCO) in 1953. 15 Five years later, BRINCO created the Churchill Falls Company
(CFL Co.) for the purpose of developing Churchill Falls' hydroelectric potential. To help finance
the project and the company, Hydro-Quebec initially bought a 17 per cent share in CFL Co.16

By 1961, BRINCO and CFL Co. were fully established and the necessary management
components were in place. However viability remained contingent on accessing North American
energy markets. Quebec insisted that if Churchill Falls electricity was to pass through its
territory then it would set the terms of access. This insistence created three possible paths to
development:


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 6
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

• develop Churchill Falls according to Quebec terms,
• have the federal government use its constitutional powers under section 92 (10) (c) of the
British North America Act (BNA Act) to enable market access, or
• find an alternate route to the North American energy markets that did not include
traversing Quebec territory.

Quebec's key term - Nationalise BRINCO

Three years of negotiations had not yielded any agreements that would allow development to
commence. In 1964, Quebec saw a potential path forward if Churchill Falls were to be jointly
developed by a partnership between two public utilities rather than through an arrangement
between a public utility and a private company. In that year, Premier Smallwood was being
pressured by Quebec's Minister of Natural Resources, Rene Levesque, to nationalise BRINCO in
order to enable the Governments of Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec to jointly develop
the project. Smallwood refused such an option due, in part, to loyalty to BRINCO shareholders
and to fears about what such a move would do to Newfoundland's international business
reputation.17 Nationalisation was proposed as a means for Hydro-Quebec to buy the electricity at
a cheaper mil rate (a mil is one-tenth of a cent)18 to save the utility upwards of $32.2 million
annually. BRINCO, as a private corporation, was required to make profits sufficient to pay aftertax dividends; a nationalised corporation would not have to account for that investment return.19

In the summer of 1965, a cheaper mil rate was secured for Hydro-Quebec when the federal
Public Utilities Income Act was changed. This resulted in a 50 - 95 per cent increase in the
transfer to the provinces of taxes collected from utility companies. Newfoundland and Labrador
passed the additional savings on to BRINCO which consequently allowed the Corporation to sell
electricity to Hydro-Quebec at a reduced price.20

While Quebec may have achieved a cheaper price, Premier Smallwood continued to investigate
the possibility of an alternative route around Quebec territory.

The Anglo-Saxon Route

In 1964, the Smallwood government contracted the engineering firm of Preece, Cardew, and
Ryder to investigate "the feasibility and economy of transmitting electric power from the
Hamilton Falls through Labrador, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into New
England, or at all events, to the New Brunswick-Maine border."21 The proposed path was
termed the "Anglo-Saxon" route.

The route would span a distance of 1710 miles and cost $941,000,000. This would inflate the
cost at which the electricity would be sold in the American market. The cost at the CanadianUnited States border would be 4.03 mils per kilowatt hour (kwh) at a proposed completion in
1974. Converting cost in Canada would increase the cost to 4.84 mils/kwh for energy delivered
in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. In the US, it would cost 5.01 mils/ kwh
delivered to Boston and New York terminals.22

A further evaluation by another engineering firm, Acres Canadian Bechtel, concluded that the
optimum price was expected to be in the area of 4 to 4.5 mils/kwh US. The high cost of

transmission would mean the economic margin would be very small and would "depend on
being able to provide non-profit transmission financed entirely by borrowing at very low rates of
interest."23

Without the possibility of meaningful profit, Acres Canadian Betchel further considered other
options (such as a cheap supply of power for the Atlantic region) that would improve the
economics for the proposed project. This was rejected as only 14% of power generated
visualised by Preece Cardew & Ryder was to be sold in the Atlantic provinces at an average cost
of 4.84 mils/kwh. This represented a saving of 1.16 mils/kwh from the 6.0 mils/kwh otherwise
available. The benefits to Newfoundland and the Maritimes would be marginal at best. In short,
the Anglo-Saxon route was not economically feasible either for sale into the international market
or for domestic consumption.24

While the nationalisation of BRINCO and the development of the Anglo-Saxon Route proved to
be non-starters, the Newfoundland government had a glimmer of hope that the federal
government would play a role in facilitating market access for Churchill River power.

The National Power Grid Idea

In the mid-1960s, the federal government was investigating the possibility of establishing a
national power grid that would link large domestic power supplies with areas having increased
energy demands. The grid was to have linked the disparate electric power sources across the
country with the regions where energy shortages were likely to develop over the ensuing years.
Canada had vast hydroelectric potential, but much of it, including the Churchill River, was
geographically isolated from the larger urban and industrial centres, especially in Ontario, where
concerns were expressed about future electricity supplies.25

The idea of an integrated national electrical system was introduced to the House of Commons by
Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker in 1962. He wanted to convene a conference where
provincial officials could discuss the basic problems with the development and transmission of
electric power.26 In a letter to Smallwood, the Prime Minister stated that, "while development
within a Province [was] a matter of Provincial jurisdiction, power developments between
Provinces [were] of interest and concern to the Federal Government."27 Diefenbaker, and other
supporters of the idea, portrayed the national transmission system as a great patriotic endeavour
akin to the construction of the transcontinental railways, or the Trans-Canada Highway, which
were critical components to the development of the national economy. 28

The government of Quebec opposed the talks. The position of the Quebec government was that
electrical transmission was within the realm of the provinces and the federal government did not
have any part to play. Quebec Premier Jean Lesage had remained consistent in his views on
transmission of Labrador power from his days as a Minister in Prime Minister Louis St.
Laurent's cabinet. As early as 1956, Lesage stated that the development and "transmission of
power from Labrador to any other province...[was] purely a provincial responsibility."29
Smallwood did not wish to jeopardise talks with Quebec and decided to send civil servant
Gordon F. Pushie to represent the province as an observer at Diefenbaker's conference.30

August 2018

Diefenbaker had been encouraged by some Members of Parliament (MPs) to push ahead with the
grid without taking the time to consult and seek provincial agreement in advance. However,
Diefenbaker decided instead to establish the Committee on Long Distance Transmission (CLDT)
and wait for its results. 31

For the next five years, the CLDT met and analyzed the cost and implications of establishing a
national power grid. Their task was made more difficult by the lack of cooperation from
Quebec. With its vast hydro-electric resources and its geographic position, Quebec was integral
to the success of any national program. Without Quebec's participation it would only be possible
to establish regional interconnections.32 While the Quebec government abstained from any form
of cooperation, Hydro-Quebec unofficially participated to a limited degree.33

In August 1965, the CLDT received a report from Ingledow Kidd & Associates Limited stating
the beneficial effects of a national power grid on the development of the Churchill Falls project.
Based upon projected power needs in Quebec, it appeared that Quebec would not be able to
absorb all the output from the Churchill development in the near future. The report anticipated,
"that [while] the inter-provincial ties could provide the means of disposing of these surpluses in
the neighbouring provinces to the economic advantage of the project and the provinces
concerned... it would be unnecessary to export any significant amount of Hamilton Falls power
to the United States."34 Less than a year later, in May 1966, Ontario-Hydro disagreed with the
report. There appeared "to be little evidence to support the assumption that Churchill Falls
power [could] be delivered to the Ontario Market economically."35

When the CLDT issued its final report a year later it concluded that there "was no doubt an
improved network would assist in the marketing of Nelson and Churchill River power."36
Despite this, the overall benefits of the plan were perceived as marginal and a further study was
deemed unwarranted.37

The British North America Act, Section 92 (10)(c)

While waiting for the CLDT's final report, the Smallwood government contemplated requesting
that the federal government use its constitutional powers to ensure Newfoundland had unfettered
access to markets in the rest of Canada and the United States. The available mechanism was
Section 92 (10)(c) of the British North America Act (BNA Act), which states:

92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to
Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is
to say,... (10) Local Works and Undertakings other than such as are of the
following Classes:...(c) Such Works as, although wholly situate within the
Province, are before or after their Execution declared by the Parliament of Canada
to be for the general Advantage of Canada or for the Advantage of Two or more
of the Provinces.38

It was not evident during the CLDT deliberations, or in the subsequent decades, that the federal
government favoured using its jurisdictional authority to declare transmissions lines from
Labrador, through Quebec and to the markets to be in the national interest. Such a declaration
could have been an important step in nullifying provincial objections.39


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 9

August 2018

There is a great deal of controversy over to what extent Smallwood pursued the Section
92(10)(c) option. There are indications that the offer may have been informally discussed, and it
was certainly a topic of consideration at both the provincial and federal levels.

In 1966, Smallwood's cabinet drafted a formal request for the federal government to use its
jurisdictional powers to declare the Churchill Falls project to be in the national interest.
However, it does not appear that the request was formally presented. Before the request was
submitted to the Prime Minister, Smallwood received word that Quebec had agreed to the terms
of a 1966 Letter of Intent which would enable the project to proceed. The agreement provided
that Hydro-Quebec would buy virtually all the power from Churchill Falls that was in excess of
the needs of Newfoundland.40 With the letter signed, Smallwood never followed through on the
request to the federal government.41

While it would take an additional three years of tough negotiations, in 1966 it appeared that the
Churchill Falls project had finally received a green light and so invoking the BNA Act did not
seem necessary to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion. However, while the project
could proceed, the core geographic issue of accessing markets remained. The fact that
hydroelectric resources in Labrador were bound by the North Atlantic Ocean and Quebec
territory did not change. That reality would re-emerge as a significant stumbling block for
negotiations in the years and decades ahead.

Negotiating the final details for the 1969 Churchill Falls Contract

The three-year period from 1966 to 1969, during which the final details of the 1969 Contract
were concluded, is steeped in controversy. The financial condition of CFL Co., and its parent
company, BRINCO, deteriorated significantly as it required a long-terms sales agreement to
ensure solvency. Academics Feehan and Baker argue that Hydro-Quebec, through its President
Jean-Claude Lessard (who was also a CFL Co. Board member), used its knowledge of CFL Co.'s
increasingly precarious financial condition to extort the final provisions of the 1969 Contract.42
The situation in 1969 was summarised by Premier Smallwood as "their (Hydro-Quebec) need to
sign was not as great or pressing as was the developer's need to sell".43 By 1969, CFL Co. and
its parent company, BRINCO, were experiencing serious cash flow problems and it became
necessary to arrange a second mortgage on the Churchill Falls development.44 By the time the
1969 Contract was ready to sign, the bargaining capacity of CFL Co. against Hydro-Quebec was
virtually non-existent.45

Nonetheless, despite requiring seventeen years of often tense negotiations, initial reactions to the
news that the final contract to develop Churchill Falls had been signed were predominantly
positive. In Quebec, the final contract was generally met with satisfaction. Quebec had secured a
deal by which it would have long-term cost-effective energy security. Quebec was anxious to
develop the Churchill, as economists were predicting that without this power development
Quebec would have to begin rationing electricity within the decade. Future Quebec Premier
Rene Levesque explained that without Churchill Falls, Hydro-Quebec would have had to face
financing large projects and borrowing money from the international financial markets where
money was "rare and expensive." While Hydro-Quebec could have "[lived] without Churchill
Falls...it [could not] live without them if it [wanted] to live the easy life."46

Beyond the lucrative sales to the Northeastern United States, having access to Churchill Falls
power became an integral part of Hydro-Quebec's domestic operations. For example, one of the
key advantages to Hydro-Quebec was the flexibility it gained during the winter months. HydroQuebec secured the ability to take more electricity from Churchill Falls during the winter months
to satisfy peak-power demands associated with increased heating demands on the system. HydroQuebec was able to use Churchill Falls electricity instead of constructing additional peak-power
plants which could have had operations costs that are up to four times the costs of operating a
base-load plant. Furthermore, the integration of Churchill Falls into Hydro-Quebec's system
helped create efficient system-wide maintenance planning.47 By the mid-1970s, it was estimated
that Churchill Falls electricity was saving Quebec customers "a minimum of $300 million
annually". In 1980, the Economic Council of Canada estimated that Churchill Falls value to
Hydro-Quebec in that year was $583 million.48

With BRINCO's sponsorship, Hydro-Quebec did not have to finance the project exclusively
from its own financial resources. In addition, the project allowed Hydro-Quebec to delay
construction of other sites. Consequently, Hydro-Quebec was relieved of the necessity of raising
capital on the money markets for other electrical generating projects. Such advantages, however,
were contingent upon Hydro-Quebec being guaranteed a low and stable price over an extended
time. Without the guarantee, Hydro-Quebec would have not become involved.49 Moreover, the
contract did not contain any price escalation clause, or provisions to re-open the contract. This
meant that if energy prices increased in the future, the additional profits would go to Quebec
which had a guaranteed purchase price out to 2041 for Churchill Falls power.

Meanwhile Hydro-Quebec's financial role and "take or buy" provisions of the contract ensured
the sales for CFL Co. This made the project economically viable and provided investors with
confidence that their investments in the project would provide acceptable returns.50 Quebec's
position was encapsulated in 2000 by MP Pierre de Savoye during a discussion with
Newfoundland MP Loyola Hearn. Mr Savoye stated: "no one wanted to support Newfoundland
in its efforts to build the dam and develop hydro-electric power: neither New York—the
Americans—nor the Canadians, nor Ottawa. Only Quebec supported Newfoundland at the time.
Although Quebec set rigorous conditions for Newfoundland, no one else would have been
satisfied with them, they would have demanded more.... many years ago. Quebec helped
Newfoundland at that time and is prepared to do so again with the development of hydroelectric
power at the border between Labrador and Quebec."51

Significant employment during the construction phase of the project and associated spinoff
economic activities provided a boost to Newfoundland's economy. In 1971, political scientist,
Philip Mathias, praised Newfoundland for not using public money to finance the project. While
securing economic benefits from the Churchill development, Newfoundland did not have to
provide "one cent for Churchill Falls". Mathias went on to claim that "...BRINCO's backers
[had] come out of the project at least as well as Newfoundland."52

For Newfoundland, the congratulatory period was short-lived. By the mid-1970s, the provincial
government was having serious misgivings about the contract's terms. The greatest perceived
problem was the lack of an escalation clause which meant when energy prices began to
significantly increase in response to energy crises in the 1970s and 1980s, Newfoundland did not
share in the resulting windfall profits. One of the most strident critics of the 1969 Contract,


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 11
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford, conceded that no one quarrelled with the contract at the
time; the problem with the contract was the fact that it was signed "for such a long time without
any reopeners or escalation clause."53

Premier Frank Moores, in a 1974 CBC interview, said that at the time the contract was fine but
unexpected inflationary pressures made the lack of a price escalation clause in the 1969 Contract
untenable; fairness dictated that the terms would have to be renegotiated before any further
developments could take place. He labeled the 1969 Contract "The biggest giveaway in
history".54 Within two years, in March 1976, the Newfoundland government were actively
soliciting professional legal opinions on the 1969 Contract and any potential legal remedies.55

The 1969 Contract would also have a significant impact on subsequent negotiations to develop
the Gull Island and Muskrat Falls sites. In the end, the 1969 Contract became a yolk around the
necks of both Newfoundland and Quebec negotiators and compounded market access
disagreements which have remained unresolved. Newfoundland continually pressed for redress
of the perceived inequities of the 1969 Contract. At the same time, Quebec was often willing to
entertain Newfoundland receiving additional benefits from the Upper Churchill. However, any
additional benefits were to be within the context of further developments of the Churchill River
as the provisions of the 1969 Contract were not to be changed. During closed-door meetings in
1976 Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa and his Minister of Energy Jean Cournoyer told their
Newfoundland counterparts, Premier Frank Moores and Minister John Crosbie, that politically
within Quebec no government could appear to be willing to be flexible about potential changes
to the 1969 Contract, or to any requests for providing additional power at a discounted price.
Premier Bourassa described it as being "political suicide" to entertain such ideas.56

1972-1979 – Frank Moores Era – Nationalising BRINCO and Energy Recall

Frank Moores' Conservative victory in the 1972 election marked the first significant change in
the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador since its joining Confederation twenty-three
years before.57 Moores became the premier of a province which in the 1970s was on the cusp of
an energy crisis. The main source of hydro-electric power on the island, Bay d'Espoir, had all of
its 450 MW potential in operation by 1970 and demand continued to exceed forecasted
reserves.58 In 1968, it was necessary to build an oil-fired facility at Holyrood, and with
extensions to the original facility; by 1976, it produced 450 MW of power.59 While there were
other smaller electrical operations on the island, the potential for expansion was slight. It was
determined that power from the Gull Island site was the cheapest energy available.60

Nationalising BRINCO and an Attempt to Develop Gull Island

In September 1972, BRINCO made a formal offer to develop the Lower Churchill, including
Gull Island. It sought terms similar to those of the Upper Churchill. BRINCO wanted power
from the Lower Churchill to be tied into the Upper and sold to Hydro-Quebec over a long-term
contract. In addition, BRINCO sought exemptions and the tax rebate as before.61 Unlike
Smallwood's regime, the Moores government refused to accept the similar terms. In 1974, after
two years of failed negotiations, Moores decided to nationalise BRINCO. Moores said that it
was "the most important resource development decision ever made by a Newfoundland

Government."62 The endeavour was presented as a matter of principle - government needed
control over resources in order to control the province's future.63

By the end of March 1974, the Newfoundland government had reached an Agreement in
Principle with BRINCO to acquire CFL Co. and all the water rights in Labrador. This left
BRINCO with its other operations such as its mineral exploration section, BRINEX.64
BRINCO's $160 million price tag was eventually accepted.65 Premier Moores believed that
nationalisation would ensure that Newfoundland's interest would be paramount in any future
Churchill River developments.66 Success of the nationalisation of BRINCO strategy was
dependent on being able to secure agreements to develop additional sites on the Lower Churchill;
such agreements proved elusive.67

When approached by Newfoundland to assist with further developing hydroelectric resources on
Lower Churchill, especially at the largest remaining site at Gull Island, the federal government
expressed its willingness to help fund needed studies and to ultimately provide financial
assistance. A joint initiative was launched to conduct the requisite engineering and economic
feasibility studies. In February 1975, the federal government indicated that it was willing to
provide loans up to $343 million for up front costs of constructing a transmission line from Gull
Island in Labrador to the island portion of the province. This would have included the building of
a tunnel across the Strait of Belle Isle and a transmission line tie-in to the Upper Churchill
transmission system. The federal government also indicated that it was willing to provide
additional assistance if the need arose. However, seven months later, revised projected
construction costs went from $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This made the project's economic
feasibility dependent upon the sale of Gull Island electricity westward. That reality necessitated
wheeling electricity through Quebec territory. The federal government remained consistent in is
preference for a negotiated agreement between the two provinces for the transmission of
electricity through Quebec. When those negotiations failed to secure a final agreement,
discussions on the Gull Island project ended.68

Attempt to Recall 800MW from the Upper Churchill

With the collapse of the Gull Island project, Moores' Minister of Energy, John Crosbie, began to
discuss with Quebec Premier, Robert Bourassa, and his Minister of Natural Resources, Jean
Cournoyer, the possibility of procuring 800 MW of power from the Upper Churchill.69 The 1969
Contract stipulated that CFL Co. was entitled to recall up to 300 MW of power with three years'
notice.70 CFL Co. had previously recalled 100 MW to be utilised in Labrador. The remaining
200 MW was insufficient to meet Newfoundland's growing needs. Consequently, the
government asked for 600 MW in addition to the 200 MW. Newfoundland insisted that it
receive power at the same price as it was being made available to Hydro-Quebec in the 1969
Contract. Hydro-Quebec did not refuse the request for power but stipulated that the energy
ought to have been sold "at a price that would cover its own replacement cost."71

During the course of negotiations, Cournoyer also suggested that in exchange for making
available the additional power there should be a change in the Labrador boundary. Cournoyer
suggested that alternatively, in order to give Quebec control over the headwaters, the
Newfoundland government could sell between seven to ten thousand square miles of territory to
Quebec. While sovereignty would remain with Newfoundland, Quebec would be able to develop

the rivers that emptied into the St. Lawrence. Moores' government rejected both the idea of
paying more for electricity that Hydro-Quebec paid in the 1969 Contract, and it firmly rejected
any changes with regards to the Labrador boundary.72 As a result, there were no further
hydroelectric developments on the Churchill River while Frank Moores was Premier.

Being frustrated with failed negotiations on further developments, the Moores' government
turned to the courts to force CFL Co. to provide Newfoundland with an additional 800 MW of
Churchill Falls power by the fall of 1983. The court case did not involve gaining additional
revenues from the Upper Churchill, but with securing additional power which the province was
going to need in the next decade. CFL Co. said it was unable to comply with the request as it
would cause the company to default on obligations to other shareholders and would cost the
company $500 million. 73

In 1982, the Supreme Court of Newfoundland rejected the province's case. The government
failed to prove that it was feasible and economic for CFL Co to comply with the request. The
crux of the court case, and the request, rested upon the proviso in section 2(e) of the 1958
Agreement that established CFL Co. That section stipulated that "the request of the government
consumers of electricity in the province shall be given priority where it is 'feasible and
economic' to do so.74 CFL Co argued that compliance with the request would render it unable to
fulfil the terms of the 1969 Contract with Hydro-Quebec and therefore it "would not be feasible
and economic to provide 800 MW of electric power to the Government."75 The final decision
agreed with CFL Co. stated that the government was entitled to ask for energy available for sale
but the energy it was requesting was "committed for sale to Hydro-Quebec [and was] not
available for sale to another consumer."76

It was a hard loss for the Moores' government; however, a development near the end of his time
in office offered hope for the future hydroelectric developments in Labrador. On 24 November
1978, Ottawa joined with Newfoundland and established the Lower Churchill Development
Corporation (LCDC). It was owned 51% by Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro and 49% by
Canada. A $14.9 million feasibility study was commissioned to investigate the potential of the
Lower Churchill River.77 The LCDC mandate was to develop the Gull Island and Muskrat Falls
sites and to supervise the construction of an accompanying transmission line.78 The feasibility
study reported that the potential of the combined sites of Gull Island and Muskrat Falls was
estimated at 2,300 MW of power. "Together these undeveloped resources have an energy
potential equivalent to 27 million barrels of oil per year, 75,000 barrels of oil per day -
forever."79 The development of the Lower Churchill "would eliminate Newfoundland's
dependence on foreign imported oil for electrical generation and also make a valuable
contribution to Canada's energy program related to energy self-sufficiency."80 However, any
positive outcomes from the LCDC initiative would occur after Moores left office.

1979-1989 – Brian Peckford Era - Quest for Wheeling Rights, Reversion and
Recall

In 1979, Newfoundland and Labrador elected Brian Peckford as Premier. His approach to
furthering hydroelectric development on Churchill River was to pursue legislative and judicial
levers to overcoming the obstacles faced by his predecessors. As explained by his Minister of


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 14
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

Mines and Energy, Leo Barry, Peckford's government had a line in the sand over future
hydroelectric developments in Labrador. Barry stated that the government had, "premised all
[their] negotiations with the province of Quebec on resolution of the Upper Churchill
situation."81 The idea of linking improved terms for Newfoundland in the Upper Churchill
contract within the broader context of further developments on the Churchill River was rejected
from the outset. Government officials explained that, despite the temptation of short term jobs
and increased economic activity, they viewed the linking of the two as trading off future benefits
to accommodate settlement of past grievances.82

Peckford informed Quebec early of the new position taken by the Newfoundland government. In
September 1979, Peckford wrote to Quebec Premier René Lévesque and stated that discussions
between the two provinces would have to concentrate on two specific issues: the price paid for
the Upper Churchill power and the issue of Newfoundland's right to recall power from the Upper
Churchill.83 Lévesque's response was cordial and expressed a willingness to discuss Churchill
River hydroelectric developments; however, it was silent on Newfoundland's two key
demands.84

Quest for Wheeling Rights and Bill 108

In lieu of pursuing negotiations on further developments on the Churchill River, Peckford turned
to the federal government for support. In 1980, Peckford wrote to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
and pleaded his case that, despite the passage of nearly two decades and a changed world energy
situation, Newfoundland's core problem remained substantively unchanged. The province found
itself "in the same position as it did in the mid-1960s when, contrary to what [Peckford believed]
to be a most basic tenet of the Canadian Constitution, [Newfoundland's] Constitutional right to
transmit hydro freely across Canadian territory was frustrated."85 Peckford claimed that
reasonable negotiations had failed and, as such, he formally requested that the federal
government act.86

Peckford explained that Newfoundland was not looking for free access through Quebec territory,
but rather proposed to "pay the going wheeling charge rather than have our brothers [Quebec] act
as brokers."87 Leo Barry argued that, "the federal jurisdiction could be utilised to force HydroQuebec to permit the wheeling....of power over their lines in return for a reasonable fee."88

At the same time that Newfoundland was looking for wheeling rights, the federal government
was pursuing Bill 108 to update the National Energy Board (NEB) Act. As federal Cabinet
Minister Marc Lalonde explained to his Quebec counterpart, Yves Duhaime, the Bill was
designed to grant the NEB similar powers with regards to electricity as it did for oil and natural
gas. Lalonde then added that "the latter powers [had] proven to be of immense economic value
to the citizens of Quebec for decades, guaranteeing access to Alberta's resources without
interference from other jurisdictions."89

At the time of its passage, Newfoundland's federal Cabinet Minister, William Rompkey,
proclaimed that with Bill 108's passage Newfoundland "finally had the guarantee of a power
corridor" and the Bill had passed despite strong opposition from the Quebec provincial
government.90 Rompkey's optimism appeared to have been misplaced. Newfoundland's Minister
of Mines and Energy, William Marshall, stated that the onerous provisions and tests that would


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 15
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

have to be met in advance of expropriation, made Bill 108 of little pragmatic use. Marshall
stated that the Bill did not improve Newfoundland's bargaining position regarding hydroelectric
developments in Labrador. 91 When Bill 108 passed, Minister Lalonde announced a six-month
delay in implementation to allow for negotiations between Quebec and Newfoundland on the
transmission of electricity through Quebec. However, consistent with the federal noninterventionist approach, he insisted that the only path forward was to first have a negotiated
arrangement between Quebec and Newfoundland. While the federal government was willing to
act as a mediator, it was not willing to enact further measures until an agreement was struck. 92
Much like what happened in 1977 with the proposed Gull Island development, progress
remained dependent upon Newfoundland being able to negotiate terms that would be agreed
upon by Hydro-Quebec before the federal government would intervene to assist the province
realise additional benefits from its hydroelectric resources in Labrador.

Water Rights Reversion Act and The Appeal of the 800MW Decision

Dissatisfied with the extent to which the federal government was willing to offer assistance, the
Peckford government embarked on a new track through the Water Rights Reversion Act which
aimed to reclaim the water rights given to CFL Co in a 1961 lease.

Peckford considered CFL Co's 1961 water lease "the cornerstone of [the] development. Without
it nothing could have been done."93 The government maintained that it was not a means to
reclaim the 5,000 MW of power which the province could not have utilised, nor did it represent
an attempt to recover $600 million in lost revenues. Instead, it was presented as drastic action
taken by a government that could not see any alternative. Peckford emphatically stated that it
was "not a move aimed at hurting [Newfoundland's] sister Province of Quebec."94 The
government pledged that the legislation would not come into force until the Supreme Court of
Canada (SCC) ruled on its validity. 95

After an examination of the constitutional basis of the legislation, Peckford felt confident that it
would "withstand any legal challenges."96 There was never any argument about the jurisdictional
rights of a province to control the natural resources within it borders. The province was
supported in the SCC case by the Attorneys General of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British
Columbia who intervened to present arguments in favour of Newfoundland and Labrador.97

If the legislation had been enacted, it would have provided Newfoundland with control over all
the output from the Churchill River, and thus it would have been able to access the 800 MW of
power which it had sought from CFL Co. but was denied when the Supreme Court of
Newfoundland ruled against the government in 1982. A reversion of the water rights would have
also placed the province in a significantly stronger position to renegotiate revenue sharing from
the Upper Churchill Falls. 98 Hydro-Quebec argued that the real purpose of the Act was to
interfere with the 1969 Contract. It was supported in its position by the federal government,
which decided to intervene in the case against the Newfoundland position when the case reached
the SCC. 99

While discussions on further developing sites on the Churchill River occurred during the SCC's
deliberations, no progress was made. Shortly before the SCC's May decision, Quebec contacted
Newfoundland with an offer of some changes to the terms of the 1969 Contract as part of a


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 16
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

broader package for developing sites on the Lower Churchill, where it would once again be the
sole broker for the electricity produced. Quebec's offer consisted of an additional $2.5 million
from the lease and access to 380 to 500 MW of power. The additional power would be
insufficient to construct a transmission line to the island. The issue of reducing the sixty-five
year term of the contract to forty years was not addressed. 100 In addition, Hydro-Quebec offered
to review the economic status of CFL Co at five or ten year intervals to ensure its survival.101
The Peckford government rejected the offer and further talks on hydro development in Labrador
remained stalled. 102

In May 1984, the SCC delivered its decision which agreed with the Hydro-Quebec/federal
government perspective. The court ruled that the purpose of the Water Rights Reversion Act was
outside the actual legislation and that it was intended to interfere with the 1969 Contract. 103,
One of Peckford's last initiatives while in office was to appeal to the SCC the 1982 decision of
the Newfoundland Court regarding the recall of 800 MW of power from the Upper Churchill. In
1988, the SCC agreed that it would not be economic or feasible for CFL Co to comply with the
request and the decision was upheld. Peckford conceded that it was the last significant legal
challenge that the province could have attempted. While Quebec remained ready to negotiate,
Peckford continued to stress the need for federal intervention. Meanwhile, then federal Minister
of Energy, Marcel Masse, continued to echo the mantra that the Churchill Falls issue was an
interprovincial dispute and that the federal government did not plan to get involved.104

By the time Peckford left office in 1988 the province was no closer to securing additional
benefits from its hydroelectric resources in Labrador. His government's insistence on the
perquisite of addressing the perceived inequities of the 1969 Contract, and his calls for the
federal government to take concrete action to allow the province to wheel power through
Quebec, failed to improve Newfoundland's negotiating position on either finding redress to the
perceived inequities of the 1969 Contract, or on further developing the Lower Churchill. In
addition, the SCC losses regarding the Water Rights Reversion Act and the right to recall
800MW of electricity, coupled with the curtailing of LCDC operations, meant that the next
Premier would have to devise a new strategy if the province was to receive greater benefits from
its hydroelectric resources in Labrador.

1989–1996 Clyde Wells – Attempted Privatisation and the Electrical Power
Control Act (EPCA)

The 16-year Conservative reign in Newfoundland and Labrador ended in 1989 with the election
of Liberal Premier Clyde Wells. During his time in office there were two key developments
aimed at securing additional benefits for the province from its hydroelectric resources in
Labrador. The first was a comprehensive offer from Hydro-Quebec to redress the 1969 Contract
as part of a package to further develop the Churchill River. The second was legislative in nature
involving privatising Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro and enacting the Electrical Power
Control Act (EPCA).

There was a substantial opportunity for progress early in Wells' mandate. Hydro-Quebec had
been experiencing substantial difficulties as a series of power outages between 1987 and 1989


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 17
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

that harmed the utility's reputation. As a result, it was asked by the Quebec government in March
1990 to prepare a five-year improvement plan.105 The difficulties were part of the motivation
behind Hydro-Quebec, in November 1989, taking the rare move of initiating negotiations related
to the Churchill River. After a series of more than 30 meetings, a draft agreement was created in
November 1991 and presented to cabinet on 12 December, 1991.

Newfoundland and Labrador was offered access to, and eventual ownership of, a substantial
block of power. In addition, the deal would have created approximately 24,000 jobs and would
have been worth approximately $14 billion in revenues and assets.106 In return, Hydro-Quebec
would have had access to a significant amount of power which it could use while it planned its
own future supplies. A critical issue, as well, was that it would have received protection from
any action taken by Newfoundland and Labrador in relation to the final 25 years of the 1969
Contract.107

While the two sides came "very close to a deal," negotiators were never able to successfully
conclude talks.108 One of the sticking points concerned the lack of an escalation clause to ensure
Newfoundland would not be stuck with a flat rate for the electricity as it had been in 1969.109 By
1992, the Hydro-Quebec reliability problems mentioned above had faded into the background
and the sense of urgency had subsided.110

Privatising Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro and the Electrical Power Control
Act (EPCA)

Premier Wells devised different means of attempting to deal with Labrador power issues. His
approach was two-pronged: privatising Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro and enacting the
Electrical Power Control Act (EPCA). With a private company in control of hydroelectric
operations, the government would have appeared to have been regulating an industry rather than
being directly involved in interfering with established contracts. The government would have
been the regulator, not the owner/operator.111

Wells' plans were thwarted by a determined opposition to the idea of privatisation from the
general public.112 But in 1994, he was successful in implementing the EPCA which theoretically
enabled the government to use increased regulating control and access provisions granted in
Section 92A of the 1982 Canadian constitutional amendment. The new edition to the
Constitution granted the provinces the right to make laws related to "development, conservation
and management of sites and facilities in the province for the generation and production of
electrical energy." It further granted provinces the right to pass laws related to raising money by
any mode, including taxation, from facilities and sites within a province for the generation of
electricity.113

Part II of the EPCA granted the Public Utilities Board (PUB) broad powers to allocate and to reallocate all power produced within the province, whether produced by a public or private
company. It further stipulated that the PUB had the ability to require an electrical producer to
make its production infrastructures available on terms dictated by the PUB, including rates,
duration and amounts of energy. Furthermore, EPCA Section 10 relieved a supplier from any
liability for failure to supply power in previous contracts due to compliance with a PUB order.114

However, in the end the legislative changes did not lead to any further progress on hydroelectric
development in Labrador.

Despite numerous changes in North American energy markets and innovative approaches to
regulating the electricity industry within the province, Premier Wells' administration did not
achieve any success in furthering hydroelectric development in Labrador. While there was a
change in regime, the Wells' administration did not have any more success than previous
administrations in terms of securing a deal to develop any of the remaining hydroelectric sites in
Labrador. The stagnant situation remained until Wells stepped down and was replaced by a
former federal MP and Cabinet Minister, Brian Tobin.

1996-2000 Brian Tobin – CFL Co. Stabilisation and Gull Island

In 1996, Tobin emerged on the provincial scene with a new attitude and approach to the
development of the hydroelectric potential in Labrador. He used a nation-wide public relations
campaign to try and bring pressure to bear on Hydro-Quebec to discuss changes in the 1969
Contract. This campaign led to media reports that Tobin threatened to "pull the plug" on
Churchill Falls and deny Hydro-Quebec a key source for electricity exports.115

While the Tobin government did not follow through on the threat, some progress was made
through side-agreements between Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec concerning the
Upper Churchill.116

An invitation to begin discussion on the Churchill River was received from Hydro-Quebec in
March 1997. The letter stated their interest in discussing a number of issues, including additional
developments on the Lower Churchill and taking measures to ensure the financial viability of
CFL Co. Without any changes to CFL Co.'s financing arrangements the company would go
bankrupt and would incur losses up to $300 million by the end of the contract with HydroQuebec in 2041.The letter suggested a steering committee be established and a number of task
forces made up of representatives from Hydro-Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador
Hydro.117

The Tobin government had three objectives related to hydroelectric developments on the
Churchill River:

• Address the inequities of the 1969 Contract
• Negotiate an agreement to enable the development of sites on the Lower Churchill for
both domestic use and international sales
• Secure provincial supply at a competitive price118

In October 1997, the Minister of Mines and Energy, Charles Furey, proposed instructing
Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro to commence discussions with Hydro-Quebec based on
three principles:

• Any resulting projects were to provide "unbalanced benefits" for the province
• Projects needed to be able to meet future anticipated power needs in the province


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 19
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

• The province was to receive royalties119

In January 1998, Tobin went public with the following six key principles which were necessary
to conclude successful negotiations:

1. Lower Churchill development must include both Gull Island and
Muskrat Falls, providing a block of power sufficient to meet the future
needs of both Labrador and the Island.
2. Provision must be made for a transmission line capable of moving up
to 800 megawatts of power to the Island.
3. There can be no long-term power contracts, like the Upper Churchill.
Instead, a floor price must be guaranteed. Any windfall from future
price increases must flow to Newfoundland and Labrador.
4. Measures must be implemented to add value at the Upper Churchill to
ensure that Newfoundland and Labrador will gain substantial value
from operations at the Upper Churchill.
5. The jobs and benefits associated with the Newfoundland and Labrador
portion of any proposed project will flow to Newfoundland and
Labrador-based companies.
6. Power rates for Newfoundland and Labrador arising out of any
development must allow for the stabilisation of both domestic and
industrial rates.120

Stabilising CFL Co.

While point four above notes the need to improve revenues from the Upper Churchill, in order to
enable the negotiations to keep going, the Tobin government agreed to not discuss changing the
terms of the 1969 Contract.121 However, two side agreements were signed which improved the
province's position regarding the Upper Churchill.

The first was a Shareholder's Agreement which allowed the Newfoundland government to put
money into CFL Co. if an infusion of cash was needed. This ensured that Newfoundland would
maintain its controlling 66% share in the company. Previously only Hydro-Quebec had the right
to inject funding and could have used the extra financing to purchase additional shares. The
agreement also ensured that the price of electricity for Western Labrador would not increase
beyond "reasonable commercial rates". Hydro-Quebec waived its right to purchase a 225 MW
block of power which would have become available in 2014.122

More significant was the agreement to enter into the Guaranteed Winter Availability Contract
(GWAC). The GWAC guaranteed to Hydro-Quebec 682 MW of additional capacity from
Churchill Falls during the winter months.123 GWAC came into force in November 1998 and is
set to last until the conclusion of the 1969 Contract in 2041 with periodic renewals. CFL Co. was
expected to receive $34 million per year for guaranteed peak power supplies during the winter
months. In contrast to the 1969 Contract, there is an escalation clause and after an initial period
of a few years, the price paid by Hydro-Quebec will automatically be tied to inflation.124 By the
time the GWAC was renewed for a second time in 2004 it was expected that the renewal would
net the province $230 million over the subsequent five year term.125 With GWAC, CFL Co's


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 20
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

future financial stability was secured and the province expected to net an additional $1 billion
dollars over the contract in additional revenues from the Upper Churchill.126

Lower Churchill Negotiations

Negotiating the further Lower Churchill developments proved to be far more problematic.
Tobin's first principle that Muskrat Falls had to be included in development plans was opposed
by Hydro-Quebec, who suggested it be postponed to a later date. Their analysis showed that only
Gull Island was viable option for sales into the US market. Hydro-Quebec's studies further
showed that Gull Island electricity could only be competitive if the transmission costs were
absorbed by Hydro-Quebec. 127

Quebec proposed two developments, an expansion of the Upper Churchill facility and the joint
development of Gull Island. They proposed to partially divert the Saint- Jean and Romaine
Rivers in order to construct an additional 1,000 MW generation station at Churchill Falls. The
deal would have provided a floor price for the additional electricity but no ceiling and
Newfoundland would have had to pay Hydro-Quebec a 2.8% commission for the marketing of
its hydroelectric energy in the North American markets.128

The Gull Island proposal was to jointly construct a 2,200 MW generating station at Gull Island
and the requisite transmission lines to get the electricity to the Labrador/Quebec border. There
was also a commitment to help conduct a $20 million feasibility study of developing the Muskrat
Falls site. The proposal would have entailed investments of approximately $12 billion, provided
6,200 jobs by the height of construction in 2004 and provided a direct line to the island portion
of the province.129

The Tobin government was insistent that development would only happen if there was a
connection to the island portion of the province as it was critical to stabilise electricity rates. His
Cabinet had heard the day before, on January 6th, 1998 that "Due to political and financial
realities, federal investment in transmission facilities to the island and Labrador [was] necessary
for the other projects to proceed." 130 The federal government initially responded that it would
help conduct a feasibility study and if the report came back positive, it was willing to become
involved. However the province and the federal government were never able to come to an
agreement and as a result the initiative to develop Gull Island was suspended.131

Premier Tobin had greater success than his predecessors in securing greater benefits from the
Upper Churchill for the province. However, hydroelectric sites on the Lower Churchill River
remained undeveloped. The next Premier to attempt to find the means to develop the Gull Island
or Muskrat falls sites was Tobin's Minister of Mines and Resources, Roger Grimes.

2001-2003 – Roger Grimes The Broader Context and Gull Island

Premier Roger Grimes came to power in 2001 at a time of significant change and opportunity for
the further development of hydroelectric power. The American energy markets were undergoing
a transformation and international concerns with limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 21
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

heightened. This section provides a brief overview of the broader circumstances that created
opportune timing for the further development of hydroelectric power in Labrador.

Deregulating the American Energy Markets

Starting in 1992, the American electric industry began the process of reforming how the
electricity market operated. In that year, the United States Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) enacted the Energy Policy Act, "FERC Order 888." The new legislation
stipulated that in order to sell into the American marketplace, companies – especially
monopolistic entities like Hydro-Quebec – would have to engage in "fair market practices" to get
a licensee to sell their energy. In order to sell into the American market, utilities had to provide
reciprocal rights and allow their infrastructures to be used by competitors.132 While designed
specifically for utilities within the United States, the extraterritorial implications meant that
Hydro-Quebec could, in theory, no longer block Newfoundland and Labrador's access to the
larger energy markets, either domestic or international.133 Political scientists Bruce Doern and
Mark MacDonald remarked that it appeared that "internal free trade for electricity in Canada
would become a made-in-the-U.S.A policy."134

The next major evolution in the transformation of the energy markets came in December 1999
when FERC passed Order 2000 which introduced the stipulation that "all transmission users
should receive access under rates, terms and conditions comparable to those the transmitting
utility applies to itself to serve its own customers."135 The measure is meant to ensure that energy
remains at a competitive price in the final marketplace despite having to be transmitted through
one or more jurisdictions.136

Once again, FERC measures govern the transmission and sale of electricity within the United
States, but this strongly affects Canadian utilities attempting to sell into American markets.
FERC Commissioner, the Honourable William L. Massey, stated at an energy conference in
Halifax in June, 1999 that "Canadian and Mexican involvement in [regional transmission
organisations] formation is welcome and critically necessary. A vibrant North American bulk
power market requires that regional institutions include all market participants."137

The impacts of the regulatory changes were reflected in Hydro-Quebec's Strategic Plan 2002-
2006, where it stated: "Opening of the electricity market and the widespread use of new
technologies have radically changed the power industry in recent years. Hydro Québec has
adjusted quickly to this new business environment by becoming more efficient" and by playing
an active role on the wholesale market.138 The market changes had been good for the company
which saw its sales increase by 50% between 1997 and 2000.139 Given the strategic importance
of the American market, it was no surprise that Hydro-Quebec was eager to be viewed as fully
embracing the revised marketplace.

The Kyoto Accord and the Quest for a Non-GHG-Emitting Energy Sources

In 1997, the United Nations Convention on Climate Change met in Kyoto, Japan, and negotiated
the Kyoto Accord which committed Canada and 36 other industrialised countries to reduce their
carbon emissions by 5.2% below 1997 levels by 2012. A year later Prime Minister Jean Chretien
signed the Accord and pledged that Canada would reduce its GHG emissions by 6% below 1990


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 22
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

levels by 2012. To accomplish that feat, Canada would have to find the means to cut emissions
by 240 megatonnes (MT) over what was expected to be emitted in 2010 if no action were
taken.140

In 1998, electricity production accounted for 17% of Canada's emissions. The oil and gas sector
accounted for an additional 18%. Due to the low levels of GHGs emitted by operating
hydroelectric plants, the development of hydroelectric energy sources was viewed as part of the
strategy to enable Canada to meet its international obligations.141 Newfoundland politicians were
arguing the case that developing the Lower Churchill alone could contribute about 15% of what
was needed to meet those obligations.142

In 2002, the importance of hydroelectric energy was noted in the federal government's Climate
Change Plan for Canada, where it was estimated that 5.4 MT could be reduced if additional
hydroelectric capacity was brought on-line by 2010. To meet that end, the federal government
and the Council Energy of Ministers (from all provinces) committed to work to find ways to ease
restrictions to the flow of electricity across jurisdictions. 143

2002 Gull Island Negotiations

It is within the broader context that Premier Grimes and his Quebec counterpart, Premier
Bernard Landry, restarted the Gull Island negotiations. The Grimes government set five
conditions for the negotiations:

• Newfoundland and Labrador would wholly own the project
• There would be an escalation clause
• The province would have the right to recall power when industrial or other demands
required
• Project benefits were to be maximised for both the province and Quebec
• The Innu had to be partners144

The first two points were clearly aimed at reminding the people of the province the contrast with
the 1969 Contract. However, the draft agreement also contained measures which caused
significant concern among others. Detractors included Dean MacDonald, the Chairman of the
Board of Directors of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, who resigned over the draft
agreement.145

The provisions that caused the most concern included that Hydro-Quebec was to be the sole
broker of Gull Island`s electricity, and it was to fully finance the entire project.146 The draft
contract was to be for 45 years and the recall provisions were also heavily restricted:

• 150MW once the project was in operation and subject to Hydro-Quebec being given five
years advanced notice
• a further 150MW would only be available ten years after operations began and
• an additional 200MW being able to be recalled after twenty years with a five year
advance notice to Hydro-Quebec

Project detractors, including then Opposition Leader Danny Williams, thought the amounts
insufficient for the province's future needs. In addition, the absences of Muskrat Falls and a
transmission line across the Strait of Belle Isle meant that the island would not receive any direct
energy supply from the Churchill River.147 Significant opposition to the draft agreement
prevented a final agreement from being concluded.

Our Place in Canada

In 2002, Premier Grimes established the Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening Our
Place in Canada, headed by long-time veteran of negotiations between Hydro-Quebec and
Newfoundland, Vic Young.148 Young had been directly involved with hydroelectric issues in the
province since 1975 when he had served on the Board of Directors of Newfoundland Hydro.
Three years later he became the Chair of the Newfoundland Hydro Group of Companies
(including CFL Co.), a position which he held until 1984 when he left to become the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Fishery Products International.149

The Commission reviewed and assessed the history of the failed strategies by various
governments to develop the Lower Churchill since 1969. The approach of the Grimes
government was described in the Commission's final report as a 'recipe for failure' as having
Hydro-Quebec be lender and purchaser would put the province in a weak position.150 The
Commission's recommendations also rejected the insistence of Premiers Frank Moores' and
Brian Peckford's governments when it said that "issues related to Churchill Falls should not be
directly linked with negotiations to develop Gull Island." 151

The Royal Commission issued its final report in June 2003 after the Gull Island negotiations had
failed and Premier Grimes only had a few months remaining in office. In November 2003,
Grimes was replaced by Conservative Danny Williams who had ousted the Liberals from
government after nearly fifteen years in power.152

2003–007 Danny Williams – Creating an Energy Plan

With a strong majority, the mantel of developing an effective strategy to develop the Lower
Churchill River fell to the Williams' government. The broader context described at the beginning
of the Grimes section still applied during Williams' first term as Premier. While climate change
became less of a concern when Kyoto-skeptic Stephen Harper became Prime Minister in 2006,
broader issues of combating climate change remained.153 Talks of establishing a national power
grid also persisted.154 As well, the implications of changes to the North American energy
markets continued to be felt.155

The Williams' government came into power at a time when the province was facing significant
economic difficulties and prospects. The strategic development of the province's vast natural
resources was viewed as key to a sustainable prosperous future.156

While in opposition, part of Williams' criticisms of Grimes proposed Gull Island agreement was
that it was negotiated in the absence of "a coherent energy plan" for the province.157 From the
outset, the new government believed that an extensive examination on multiple fronts had to be


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 24
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

conducted to glean the lessons from previous attempts to develop the Churchill River's
hydroelectric resources and to best position the province to maximise the benefits of all its
natural resources going forward.158 As a result, the Williams' government did not immediately
attempt to engage in negotiations to develop hydroelectric resources in Labrador; first they
would study the current circumstances using all the expertise required and survey the realms of
possibilities before developing negotiating strategies.159

A key step in learning about the current state of possibilities came in January 2005 when the
government issued a Request for Expressions of Interest and Proposals for Development of
Lower Churchill Hydro Resource. The process was open to any group that had the interest and
ability to make a proposal. The initiative was described as the first step in what would be a four
phase process.160

While the government received twenty-five proposals, a joint proposal from Hydro-Quebec and
Ontario to develop the Lower Churchill attracted significant attention. TD Bank proclaimed that
the Lower Churchill's "day in the sun may have finally arrived."161 However, the proposal was
predicated on the same assumptions dating back to the Upper Churchill contract negotiations.
Labrador power would be sold to Hydro-Quebec, which would then resell the power to the
customer. The proposal did not contain provisions for the wheeling of power through Quebec,
but rather insisted that Newfoundland negotiate terms with Hydro-Quebec which would in effect
retain exclusive rights to sell Churchill River power in the North American markets.

The Williams' government rejected the Hydro-Quebec/Ontario proposal and announced in May
2005 that the province would develop the Lower Churchill itself and would continue to seek
partners to ensure Lower Churchill sites were developed with the maximum benefits accruing to
the people of the province. In lieu of selling to Hydro-Quebec, the Premier announced that it had
submitted an application to Quebec that would grant wheeling rights to the North American
markets.162

The government had made a major decision concerning the general principle it would adopt
going forward, and now it turned its attention to understanding the broader context. In November
2005, the government released a Discussion Paper to engage citizens in creating a
"comprehensive Energy Plan for Newfoundland and Labrador."163 Those discussions and
provided an input into the creation of Focusing Our Energy.

The focus on the future and the lessons learned from the previous four decades of Churchill
River negotiations were evident in Focusing Our Energy. The 1969 Contract, which expires in
2041, looms large throughout the entire document and is specifically mentioned ten times. A
critical part of the province's energy plan was to ensure that CFL Co. maintains the Churchill
Falls facility such that it is in optimum condition in 2041.164

Focusing Our Energy also provides evidence that the Williams' government had studied issues
associated with developments since the 1960s to develop the Lower Churchill River and
incorporated lessons learned. For example, in granting the "energy corporation" water rights, it
was noted that this would not interfere with existing contracts. That statement acknowledges the
Supreme Court Decision in the previously mentioned Water Rights Revision Act. The Supreme
Court had decided against Newfoundland and Labrador, in part, on the belief that the intent of


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 25
Cleo Research Associates Background Report for Commission of Inquiry Respecting the Muskrat Falls Project
August 2018

the Act was to interfere with the 1969 Contract.165 Similarly, Premier Clyde Wells' enactment of
the Electrical Power Control Act (EPCA) had an analogous aim, but it did not lead to any
advances on the Churchill Falls front. The Williams' government amended the EPCA in 2007 to
allow the PUB to directly regulate the coordination of power production and water management
arrangements. When mentioned in Focusing Our Energy, it was immediately followed by the
explanation that: "The amendment provides that all relevant delivery commitments under
existing power contracts can be honoured, including the 1969 power contract for the Upper
Churchill."166

While of utmost importance (as it had been in previous decades), developing the Lower
Churchill was presented as an ultimate goal, but not one that would be achieved at any costs.167
The electricity chapter of the Focusing Our Energy reflected caution towards future
developments when it stated that if plans to develop the Lower Churchill did not proceed as
planned then the province had a back up plan to fill expected demand using a combination of
thermal, wind and small hydroelectric developments.168

Focusing Our Energy's overall message concerning Churchill River hydroelectric developments
was that the government planned to have the province in the best possible position to reap the
maximum benefits of sustainable hydroelectric developments in Labrador over the long term.169
The government spent nearly four years since coming into power in 2003 studying multiple
aspects of the past, present and possible futures of hydroelectric development in Labrador.170
However, at the time it was not clear if an effective means had emerged that would allow the
province to get Labrador energy to market without Hydro-Quebec being in the position of sole
broker. The ability to wheel power to the markets remained dependent on external circumstances
and political decisions at national and international levels. The previous decades of experiences
in attempting to secure hydroelectric developments in Labrador had shown that if Newfoundland
and Labrador was dependent upon Hydro-Quebec as its only customer, it put the province in a
weakened negotiating position. Former Newfoundland and Labrador Energy Minister, Mr.
William Marshall once stated "if parties [could] not negotiate on equal footing, inequities [were]
bound to result."171

Fifty-five years had passed since the first concrete steps were taken, through BRINCO's
creation, to develop the Churchill River's vast hydroelectric resources and yet the core issue of
access the broader North American energy markets remained.

Transmission Line to the Island

It is within the context of ending Hydro-Quebec's status as sole-broker for Churchill River
electricity that Focusing Our Energy stressed the vital importance of building a transmission line
to the island to ensure the province was able to fully realise the benefits of its hydroelectric
resources in Labrador.172

In his official history of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, historian Melvin Baker stated that
since the 1960s a multitude of economic and technical reports have shown "that the most
economic long-term alternative" for electricity supply on the island portion of the province was
through a transmission line from Labrador, especially through the development of the Gull Island
and Muskrat Falls sites.173 By 2007, 35% of the province's electricity was thermal-generated

August 2018

which had associated with it fuel price volatility as well as 1.3 million tonnes of GHG emissions
and other emissions sulphur dioxide and particulate matter. Moreover, it was expected that by
2015 the province would be looking for additional sources of supply.174 The construction of the
transmission link was viewed as key to future electricity rate stability, sustainable development
and the development of other renewable energy resources such as wind. The plan stated "The
Labrador-Island link will enable us to meet almost all our electricity demand with clean,
renewable electricity, essentially with no emissions."175

However, it is within the context of 2041 that the transmission lines assumed extra significance.
The energy strategy noted, on numerous occasions, the fact that the 1969 Contract expires in
2041 and the province assumes full control over the Churchill Falls facility. However, the power
lines that connect the generating station to the North American energy markets will remain
owned, operated and controlled by Hydro-Quebec. In 2007, it was far from clear that the
province would be able to use any of: changes in the US energy markets (began in the 1990s),
Ontario's and the Maritime's energy supply challenges, and international climate change
concerns (coupled with Canada's international commitments) to ensure market access.176
Consequently, in 2041 the province could have not been in any better a position to negotiate
access to the markets than it had been in the 1960s or in the decades since. Moreover, the
province had negotiated provisional power supply agreements with American customers, but
without the means to get energy to markets, such arrangements were moot.177

A transmission line from Labrador to the island and then across the Gulf of St. Lawrence through
the Maritimes and into the United States, fundamentally altered future discussions concerning
market access. Focusing Our Energy had acknowledged that the province's "direct transmission
access to export markets [was] extremely limited." 178 The plan noted that the government was
examining two potential export routes. The first was the most direct route which was through
Quebec. Unlike in previous decades, the province saw an opportunity to gain domestic and
international market access through Quebec territory but using Hydro-Quebec's Open Access
Transmission Tariff which had been developed in response to FERC regulatory changes
mentioned earlier. 179

As it was not clear if the province would be able to leverage access changes in the US market,
the province was examining a subsea link to the Maritimes and then to the Northeastern United
States. The province was optimistic that technology had sufficiently advanced since the 1960s
when Premier Smallwood's investigations into the possibility of an Anglo-Saxon route following
the same basic path was found to be unfeasible. Moreover, the plan pointed to the 580 km
NorNed subsea link that united Norway's and the Netherland's electricity infrastructures as proof
that the 425 km subsea route it was proposing was feasible.180

The end of the beginning for the Williams' government

Following nearly four years of intensive multi-disciplinary strategising on negotiating additional
Lower Churchill hydroelectric development, the Williams' government felt it had sufficient
information to present a comprehensive long-term energy plan that was expected to have a major
role in shaping the future of the province. However, the determination to develop the Lower
Churchill on its own terms and the lack of clarity on the best path forward were evident in
Focusing Our Energy.

It was hoped that by understanding the full energy picture, the province would be in the best
possible position to benefit from its vast hydroelectric resources in Labrador. The inclusion of a
transmission line linking Labrador to the island, through the Maritimes and to the US markets
beyond ensured that future discussions would be fundamentally different than in previous
decades. While not necessarily ensuring a level negotiating table, having a viable alternate route
to the markets significantly strengthened the provinces' relative negotiating position when
discussing Labrador's vast hydroelectric resources.

The Williams' government saw Focusing Our Energy as a foundational piece that would create
the conditions in which the province could achieve sustainable prosperity for its citizens through
the intelligent, coordinated and fact-based development of its natural resources.181 Critical to that
vision was the exploitation of the Churchill River's hydroelectric resources to the benefit of the
people of the province. It was the continuation of a dream in the province that extended back to
the years before Newfoundland and Canada joined in 1949.

Conclusion

The expression "the more things change the more they stay the same" encapsulates the overall
theme of negotiations to develop the Churchill River's hydroelectric potential. The geographic
isolation of Labrador's hydroelectric resources has dominated discussions from Confederation in
1949 to the publication of Focusing Our Energy in 2007.

The signing of the 1969 Churchill Falls contract took seventeen years of arduous negotiations
and established a pattern of events which was repeated when subsequent discussions of further
hydroelectric developments took place. Quebec insisted on its jurisdictional rights concerning the
wheeling of electricity through its territory. The tone was largely set by Quebec Premier Jean
Lessage in 1965, when he stated that Quebec would never allow a transmission line through its
territory that any electricity that ever entered Quebec territory would "become property of
Hydro-Quebec".182

In response to Quebec's position, Newfoundland governments sought alternative jurisdictional
and geographic means of accessing the energy marketplaces. Meanwhile, the federal government
provided substantial financial and technical assistance but stopped short of enacting
political/constitutional measures that would likely have caused upset in Quebec.183 The federal
government consistently insisted that Newfoundland and Quebec had to mutually agree to a
negotiated settlement on the wheeling of electricity from Labrador through Quebec territory to
the domestic or international markets.

Throughout the 1970s, 80s, 90s and into the 2000s, energy demands in the North American
markets remained high with increasing energy transfers among jurisdictions and with an overall
trend towards establishing open markets. Domestically, the idea of establishing a national power
grid to facilitate the development of renewable energy sources and to provide sustainable power
to major energy demand centres, such as in Southern Ontario, was periodically discussed.

Meanwhile, the Northeastern United States consistently increased imports of Canadian energy.
As well, American energy markets evolved to embrace open access principles where, in order to


CIMFP Exhibit P-00008 Page 28

August 2018

sell into the US markets, utilities would have to allow other electricity generators to access their
transmission infrastructures to access the markets.184 There were times, such as during the
energy crises of the early 1970s and 1980s, and the push for non-green-house gas emitting
energy sources in the late 1990s and 2000s, when circumstances seemed especially opportune for
the further hydroelectric development on the Churchill River. However, final development
agreements were never concluded.

The long history of attempts to sign final agreements on developing hydroelectric sites on the
Churchill River influenced the writing of Focusing Our Energy. For Newfoundland and
Labrador from 1949 to 2007, governments, individuals and market circumstances may have
changed but the core issue of getting electricity from Churchill River sites to the potentially
lucrative energy markets did not. Since 1969, technical feasibility, economic conditions, and
environmental imperatives have not facilitated the signing of final agreements to enable Lower
Churchill projects to proceed. That historical context reflected the 2007 report's insistence on a
flexible strategic approach to future negotiations to harness the remaining power of the Churchill
River. The inclusion of the Labrador-Island Transmission link has added a new wrinkle to the
established narrative. Time will tell if it means that things have changed utterly, or if the goals of
Newfoundland and Labrador premiers since Confederation to have the province reap the full
rewards of the Churchill River's hydroelectric resources will remain elusive.

• While not the explicit focus of the book, The Power of Commitment does an exceptional
job putting the negotiations to develop Churchill River hydroelectric resources within the
broader setting of the electricity supply challenges faced on the island from the 1950s to
the end of the century. During that time the province was fundamentally transformed
through initiatives, such as the drive for rural electrification, which created strong supply
demands for electrical power. Baker clearly describes the costs and consequences of the
province's inability to access Labrador electricity.

Journal, Volume 32, 2007.
• This article is highly recommended as it provides an in-depth analysis of the profound
impact on the Canadian electricity sector of changes brought in the US energy markets.
Author Blue also warns of the perils of domestic jurisdictional and regulatory structures
which prevent the Canadian electricity sector from fully capitalizing on domestic and
international market opportunities. The article goes on to explain how structural
difficulties also prevent broader benefits such as supporting the development of
renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions at the national level.
