Hydro-Québec’s Exports:
Update, October & November 2025
Summary Findings and Some Questions
Doug May

The Noose Continues to Tighten on HQ
• Falling Exports: Even with imports adding to the available
electricity, with falling supply, there is little room for exports for
many months. During March-June 2025, less than 4% of the total
available was exportable, while in March-June 2022, at least 12%
was available.
• Exports by HQ to the USA in October were almost 92% lower than
the same month three years earlier.
• The decline was spread along its markets in Vermont, New York State and
Maine with Vermont being the primary market. HQ’s spike in the colder
winter when demand and prices are high. An opportunity for HQ to make
substantial profits during this period exists.

Some Questions: Exports
• Exports
❖Why are CER data on exports not consistent with HQ
information.
➢CER states that no electricity is exported to NE-ISO. HQ
2025 semester report says it is our primary customer.
Why the difference???
➢Why in the first six months of 2025 was the average sale
price for HQ power into NY State 15.81¢/kWh while NLH
power was 8.2¢/kWh? Transmission costs?
➢Why are CER’s export data for New York state not
consistent i.e. Price x quantity does not equal value,
when it is consistent in other cases?

Update, October & November 2025
Findings: Supporting Evidence

Talking Note (TN) 1
• Almost all of the electricity available( including CF) is increasingly
needed to meet domestic needs.
• This leaves little electricity for export including that needed for
long term commitments to other provinces, principally New
Brunswick.

• Most of the electricity produced in Quebec comes from Hydro-Québec’s
operations.
• We can assume that it is Hydro-Québec that does the importing and
exporting of electricity.
• The chart below shows a general decline in the export of available power by
HQ.
• HQ and Quebec are net importers of electricity and Churchill Falls is a
significant (and very inexpensive) source of those imports.
The amount of electricity available for export in October was down by 5.5
percentage points from a year earlier and 14.6% points from that month 3 years
earlier.

• HQ exports increased in July by almost 15 % from the same
month a year earlier, fell by almost 70% over the past three years.
• HQ states that its sales data in the first half of this year was 6 TWh
(6 million MWh). Stats Can data are consistent with this figure.

• Exports to the USA in October were down by 12.5% from the same
month in 2024 and 91.9 % from three years earlier.
• Exports to other provinces to other provinces were up 22.2%
year/year in October but fell just over 29% over the past three
years.
• In the diagram below note the growing relative importance of trade
within Canada.
• Export commitments to NB dominate commitments to U.S.
states.
• Note also that suggestions in the MOU to base Churchill River’s
electricity prices on specific markets might acknowledge
changing trade patterns.

• According to the Canada Energy Regulator data Vermont seems to
be the dominant export market for HQ with NY State not far
behind.
• Exports to Maine from HQ seem sporadic.
• CER data report no significant sales from Quebec into New
England –ISO. However, HQ Quarterly reports often refer to New
England-ISO and the prices it receives there. It is not clear HQ’s
reason for doing this.
• NLH seems to be taking over the NE market according to CER and
increasing its exports into NY.

• The amount of electricity that Quebec exports to the USA has been
much larger than Newfoundland and Labrador has.
• Once electricity is in the grid it is likely impossible to say where is was
generated.
• The decrease by Hydro-Quebec in its electricity sales to the USA over
the last four years is remarkable. Keep in mind, that while most people
might believe that Quebec is a net exporter of electricity to the USA, it
is a net importer.
• Also keep in mind that HQ has invested vast amounts of money over
the past couple of years constructing and upgrading transmission lines
into the USA. It promotes hydroelectricity as green energy

• While there is not a pattern here. It is interesting that it is NL and
not Quebec that ships electricity into New England. Quebec had
entered into agreements with NE-ISO to export cheap green
hydroelectric power into states such as Massachusetts. To do this
it built new transmission lines through Maine, which were very
controversial due to environmental concerns.
• In early 2026, a kWh of electricity is about 33¢ US or 45.5¢
Canadian. This price is about 3X the current price to households
in St. John’s.

• The pattern of export prices into selective US markets using Canada
Regulator Data seems to be increasingly inconsistent and unreliable.
• How can trade prices be negative? Why are there extremely high prices in one
market and not in others? Why does price x quantity not equal value when
dealing with exports from NL but not from Quebec.
• My repeated email requests and phone calls to CER in Calgary have been met
with silence or a non-response. Reliable price data are necessary to
determining the potential value of Churchill River electricity and water rents.
• These data problems must be resolved before any adjustment price process
for electricity outlined in subsequent negotiations can be implemented.
• If there is a seasonal price pattern. Export prices are the highest in the
coldest months and then increase somewhat in July and August!
• Since electricity production and exports follow seasonal patterns then prices
should not be set annually but seasonally which is what Hydro-Québec does
in its export markets and is moving towards in its domestic markets.

• The chart below and comments come from the 2025 mid-year
report from Hydro-Québec.
• The higher export price in the winter of 2025 is probably due to
colder temperatures when increased demand competes with
supply constraints.
• The price pattern for 2025 seem to be consistent with CER’s report
for NL exports to NE.
• It is not clear why Hydro-Québec reports sales to New England
when CER reports that it does not export there. Another puzzle to
be solved.

“The company increased electricity
exports to take advantage of high prices in
a context marked by strong demand.”
Semi-Annual 2025 Report from Hydro-
Quebec.
On markets outside Québec, weather
conditions experienced during the first few
months of the year caused energy prices to
increase overall.

HQ’s Mid-year Statement, 2025

The Bottom Line
• HQ has a reputation as an energy powerhouse able to provide clean
energy and meet the needs of markets in the USA.
• HQ’s exports continue to fall due primarily to declining hydroelectric
production resulting from the continuing drought.
• Exporting electricity is profitable at any time but particularly in the
winter months when prices are high. A key component of this process
is using hydro reservoirs a storage batteries.
• Any “profit” is used by HQ to reduce electricity prices to its domestic
customers. Quebec follows profit-maximizing principles in operating
outside Quebec.
• The key to making all this strategy work is very cheap and abundant
power from CF. It’s a necessity for HQ. It’s natural and rational that
hydro Quebec can best meet its supply shortfalls by increasing
production at CF and Gull Island.

Thanks for watching!

Imports from NY 84.6% -47.2%
Nice story for 2024: Cost of importing electricity into Quebec from USA has risen. Wonky data for
2022. Solution: Clean up the data and double-check the sources.

A Summary
• This declining generation has led HQ to curtail exports to the USA
and increase its power imports from New York State. HQ is
currently a net importer with the USA. This is a significant change
in historical patterns.
• Prices of imports from and exports to the USA are generally rising.
This increases the relative attractiveness of Churchill Falls power
with its very low, relatively fixed cost.
• Check the data sources on prices. Export volumes from CER and
Stats Can are consistent but electricity price data from Stats Can
are not available.
